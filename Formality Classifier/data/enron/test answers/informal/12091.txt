Hello David,
I have been out of the office at a meeting.  Sorry that I couldn't turn this
around earlier today. My contact in legal is Michele Leflar. She can be
reached at 609-520-4041.  Her e-mail address is
Michelle.Leflar@dowjones.com.  I do not have Michelle's fax number at this
time, but can get it to you tomorrow.  I have left a message for Michelle so
that she will be expecting the call from your legal department.
I don't know if this can be resolved by 9:00 AM central time, but we can
certainly try.
Looking forward to meeting you,
fb
