Jason/Riley,

I need to know of all breaks by e-mail before we leave at night.  We also need to have them in the system the way the traders know them at night before we leave.  The traders will take the heat if they say a trade is good after we bring a break to their attention.  I am trying to work w/ Mechelle on the margin verification in the morning, and it becomes a useless exercise when the we have breaks each morning.  We're paying (or receiving) the wrong margins when this happens.  The margin value is also signed off on by my boss and by someone above him.  I am not comfortable continuing to ask them to sign off on incorrect values.
