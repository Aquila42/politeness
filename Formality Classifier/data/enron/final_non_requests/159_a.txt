Beth Perlman and Bob Hall will call us later today when they are ready to discuss EA cost savings.

Spreadsheet is attached - thanks so much for putting this together.

I will follow up with Jeff Johnson on open questions for EGM/EIM.

I have just (at 2:15 pm ) reconfirmed with Dan Leff that EES expects no changes to their budget dollars from ENW, but will certainly take any cost savings that we may be able to find for them.  One possibility is replacing more expensive contractors with employees displaced from other teams.
