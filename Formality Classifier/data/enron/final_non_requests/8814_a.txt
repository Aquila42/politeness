Larry - Sue has done an nice job of providing an outline of what is
required.  As you will see do not worry about the 30 day rule for materials
that we are not actively managing.  When you see the timetable for the EPA to
respond you will realize that....

this is a big help but a lot of work is required and we will need Donna
Mullins to sign off on what we discussed....
