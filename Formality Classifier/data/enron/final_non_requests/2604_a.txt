Thanks for sending the chart.  I will send you the list of questions we
discussed tomorrow.  In the interim, I had a couple of questions on the
chart:  On the first line (physical, no master), is the basis for not
requriing the confirm to be signed the UCC?  Also, what is meant by "unless
commodity not 'good'"?
Thanks.
