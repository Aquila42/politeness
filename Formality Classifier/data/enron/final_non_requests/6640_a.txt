Sara,

As we discussed, attached is the memo that I wrote last September on the tax
implications of having a financial trader in Sydney.  As you will note, we
followed a service fee approach to reimburse the Sydney office on a cost-plus
basis for the costs incurred by the financial trader (including his
remuneration).  Important in this arrangement is that the Sydney financial
trader is not the principal in the trades but is only acting in a preparatory
or auxiliary manner for the ENA financial trades.

As we discussed yesterday, I will forward the latest draft of the service
agreement to you by e-mail.  David, could you send Sara and me conforming
copies of the executed agreement?

Also, we should probably also discuss the status of the documentation
relating to these trades.

I will be happy to discuss this memo with you in more detail at your
convenience.

Best regards,
Susan
