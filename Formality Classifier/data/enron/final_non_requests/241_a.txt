Hi!

You are so sweet to think of me. I am sorry I did not repsond sooner but I have been very upset and angry with the executives at Enron.  I have been fortunate and not been hurt as bad financially as so many others.  Still we have lost a great deal of money.  Second to that, however, is the pride issue.  I still struggle with having to answer questions from people about the validity of Enron.  I quess I have been here to long to have a sense of humor about all that has happened - hopefully time will help.
One good thing that has come out of this is the assurance from existing upper management that we are the heart and soul of the company and they hope we stay around until the end of the year before we consider other options.  Maybe the old timers with experience will look a little better to them now.  Those with less years will probably take their bonus and run.  Take Care! Hope everything is going well with you and your family.
