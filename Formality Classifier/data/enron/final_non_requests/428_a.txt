Greg,

I spoke to Michelle at Grande.  She is making the changes to the annual rate increase and the subsequent owner from your comments.  I wanted to explore using the credit to reduce the monthly costs if that would allow expenses/unit to be lower.  However, since the contract is for 5 years there doesn't seem to be much point.  I guess we should just take the check.

Are you happy with the agreement otherwise?
