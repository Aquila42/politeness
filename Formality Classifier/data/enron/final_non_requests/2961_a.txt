I guess he won't be by as he knows it all now. And if he doesn't it will be
my fault for not teaching him correctly.

Supplemental to our conversation yesterday; I would come back to help you
with a project or job for which you needed any of my talents. If it involves
working with this guy ---- FORGET IT.

P.S. I have not taught him well as things are still being done incorrectly.
