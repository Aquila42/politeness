Peter
got your voice but it was a little late to call. I will call you tonight. But
let me briefly cover the points you mentioned
On insurance I have faxed across our legal opinion on weather. We prepared a
detailed discussion on insurance in a schedule. But the main point is that
there is no  nexus between damage/loss suffered by a party and payments under
the weather derivative.
On access to data Christian Werner in Sydney is researching alternatives. I
was proposing to forward details of these arrangements so they could be
double checked by B &M.
Mark Taylor has been copied in on our documentation (GTCs and product
description form) for Australian weather. We have also been working with Paul
Simon, Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd in London.
Korea is becoming more of a possibility. Although not settled that we will be
offering these products it is becoming more likely.  Hence we may have some
work there.
