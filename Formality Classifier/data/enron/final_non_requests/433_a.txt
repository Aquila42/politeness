Marde,

Attached is the information from EOG Resources that we discussed late last week.  I am going to meet with Marc Eschenburg on Tuesday March 5th for lunch and would like to be able to provide some answers to him at that time.

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,

Richard

Sorry to keep bothering you but our accountants corrected me and said the
last month we got paid was August '01 not September '01.

Thanks again for your help.

Richard,

Thanks for following up on this issue.

Summary of the issues:
EOG sold gas to Enron Energy in West Virginia via Enrons pool on CNG
The EOG wells that are involved are the Cox, Riddle(2) and Langford(3)
wells, combined production 57 mcfd
The associated meters are:    Cox        351 4501/RP11839-02
Riddle          351-4601/RP11883906
Langford  351-1101/RP1183903

EOG Accounting says the last month EOG was paid was September 2001.
CNG (Dan Blaney?) stated to EOG that Enron must request in writing to
CNG that Enron no longer desires to have EOG gas put in Enron's pool.
CNG will not let EOG remove its gas from Enron's pool without Enron
notifying CNG.  CNG says it has to do with bankruptcy and lawyers.

EOG would like one of the following results:
EOG would like to be paid by Enron or Enron's designee, for
October 2001-February 2002 and have Enron notify CNG that effective
3/01/02,            Enron does not desire to have EOG's meters go into the
Enron pool on CNG,        or
EOG would like Enron to notify CNG that effective 10/1/01, Enron
was not the pool receipient of EOG's three meters and EOG has the right to
market their production to others effective 10/01/01

Can you get me in touch with the correct Enron person so we can remedy this
problem.  I am considering shutting in the production because I have not
been paid by Enron and  cannot get a new pool purchaser without permission
from Enron.  This process seems very awkward and I would greatly appreciate
your help on either option I have proposed above.

Thanks
