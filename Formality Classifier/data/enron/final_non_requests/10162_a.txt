Rosie -- please check Ken's calendar.  This would be a great one to do if we
can squeeze it in.
Nick -- congrats on what looks like a great new opportunity to make
progress.  I am in all week and would love to talk to you and Joe.  If we
can't otherwise make schedules work, call me at home after hours Houston time
