Sorry for the delay.... here are some general answers to a these questions.

1. the two way on a 10 year nymex swap on volumes between 20,000 and 100,000 MMbtu per day will range between $ .10 / MMbtu up to $ .50/ MMbtu.  It may take anywhere from 1 week to one month to liquidate/hedge.

2. Contracting for floors has some appeal, and for sure upside but liquidity passed year one is very small and time value on premium could be a killer... collars may work but bid/ask inside derivative may create to tight a range. There are a variety of structures that can be created for the hedge including put swaptions, ( one time strike), and monthly calls, these may be a little cheaper but the order or magnitude will probably not show up on a spreadsheet once all these numbers are on it.

3.  I have been involved in a handful of transactions directly or indirectly including 15 year nymex, 23 year transportation and long term gas supply including a 50,000 MMbtu/day 17 year index structure where we filled long term gas supply for the CFE ( mexico). The liquidity, credit risk, and transactability is scewed to the 1st, 2nd and perhaps 3rd year.. anything longer than that that involves fixed price and term is sloppy.

In this early stage hedging against the nymex may make alot of sense... especially when the current/spot spreads to socal are so tight to the Nymex... keeping the basis open may create a implied ( free option) to your client with minimal downside risk...
