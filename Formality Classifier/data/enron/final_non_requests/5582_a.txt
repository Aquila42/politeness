This is the David's answer:
The only one that I can think of that may be of use is the "CES Volume
Comparison" report ... that is the one that ya'll had for January that showed
all of the purchases and sales, by pipeline.  It is available for any month.
The reports that I regularly used were for helping to clean up current month
activity, which would not be of any use to you.
