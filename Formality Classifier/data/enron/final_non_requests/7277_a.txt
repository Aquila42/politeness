Yes - please go ahead and forward a copy to Ed.  I don't think Mark Holsworth
needs to be involved in this one.  Unfortunately, I don't know of anything
directly on point other than the agreement we negotiated the last time (I
guess Justin coordinated that - I don't remember reading it).

Mark:

I just received the ISN contract for the Olympics game.  Should I send a copy
to Ed at Milbank as well?  Any reason Mark Holsworth needs to be involved?
I have reviewed numerous license agreements and feel comfortable with many of
the issues, but I do not hold myself out as an IP expert.  Have we entered
into similar agreements with other content providers that would be good
precedent for my review.
