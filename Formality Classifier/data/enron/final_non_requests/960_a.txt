Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have
had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a
better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and
manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very
solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then
ultimately in origination.

I hope this helps.

Regards
Delainey
