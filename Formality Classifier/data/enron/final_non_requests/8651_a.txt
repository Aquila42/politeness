David:

I asked Kevin when the issue of altering B/L's, or any documentation
(contractual or logistical) for that matter, first came up in Helsinki or
London.  Following is in response.  How does the timing (ie. last April per
Kevin) compare to your understanding?  Specifically, I want to know the date
it was first noted and raised as individuals in Helsinki said the issue had
been raised up to 2 times prior to April of last year (as early as Late
1998).  Likewise, do you know what exactly was communicated on any occasions
in 1998 or 1999 with Helsinki or London staff on this issue?  When I asked
Henkka what had occurred previously, he had no recollection of any
communication on this last April.
