Steve,

Early this week I asked Jo for a rate and the size (looking for the max volume) of volume we could have for transportation on NNG from WT to PH(NNG/TW Gray).  I've got a couple of calls into her, but she has not gotten back to me yet.  I hope to have a response from her before we meet with Mike Stage on Tuesday.  I'll keep you posted.

Kim.
