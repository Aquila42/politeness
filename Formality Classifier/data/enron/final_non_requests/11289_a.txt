Attacked are comments received this morning from Reynolds Metals on a
combined transportation/sale transaction that they have been working relative
to Reynolds Gregory plant.   Reynold's comments to the Form of Enfolio Master
extensive and I'm going to need your help sorting out which ones we can work
with and which ones are non-negotiable.  I'll be able to take care of the
Transportation comments.  I'll let you know when Greg and Lee are ready to
meet on this matter.
