Dan, Thanks so much for sending this to me as I had not heard the details of
our employees' incredible response to the Genesis leak.  Talk about "going
the second mile" -  I am so proud to say that I am in the same company as
they are!  We need to feature this in our next EOTT newsletter and nominate
one or more employees for the Enron annual Chairman's award.

In cleaning out my email inbox, I ran across this email which I had intended
to forward to both of you.  If you will recall, recent field information
indicated the expense of cleaning up this leak had already exceeded $9
million by 1/7/00.

Luckily this leak wasn't ours.  Our employees responded quickly and provided
what assistance they could to Genesis until the Emergency Responder arrived.
