I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.  If you
look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.  His e:mail to
Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's
group.  Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a
group in which they may have an interest.  I don't think that HR gets
involved in this process.  I am not sure how I got into this loop.  It seems
that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his
group then he should talk with Nelson.  --Sally
