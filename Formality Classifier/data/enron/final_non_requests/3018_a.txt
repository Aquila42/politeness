Sensitivity in both FO and Risk Management Control around the acurracy of p&l
and risk post the recent continental book split placed an additional ( &
necessary) 'manual' step within our reporting process. As we have progressed
the book split we anticipate a return to normal service
Clearly we will watch closely to ensure this meets Houston requirements
