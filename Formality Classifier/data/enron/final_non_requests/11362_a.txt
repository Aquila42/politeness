Good morning all.  We apologize that we are not going to be able to have
our Holiday Party before the first of the year.   We wanted to use the Scout
House in West University like we did last year and it was not available.

Vince suggested that with the move and a lot of people taking vacation that
we wait until after the first of the year.  This way you can take advantage
of
"after Christmas sales"  for your gift!

Just remember whose name you have and we will schedule an "offsite"
after the first of the year.

Thanks!

Shirley
