Subject: Deposition Reporting

Kathy:

I notice that a number of parties to one or more of the NSM cases have
jointly entered into an agreement with Esquire Reporting concerning
deposition reporting.

Just to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to confirm that ECT Securities was
not consulted with respect to this agreement and is not a party to it. In
the event that we notice our own depositions, we will use Esquire as a
convenience to the other parties. We will make our own arrangements with
Equire to obtain copies of transcripts of depositions noticed by others.

Thanks.

See you in Fort Wayne.
