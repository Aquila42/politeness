Since the main entrance to our building is not yet open, visitors to UBS Warburg Energy's offices in Houston must check in at the security desk of the Enron Building at 1400 Louisiana St. in downtown Houston.  In connection with our meetings this Friday, guests should give either my name or Jim Steffes as the person they are visiting.  We will be called and send someone over to escort visitors across to our offices.
