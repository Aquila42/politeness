Sarah,
The Financial trading group would like to enter into a a prime trading
agreement with First Boston. They have an internet-based
futures trading program which holds a certain amount of appeal for us and we
would like to expedite the process of gaining access to this system. I wanted
to let you know in advance and will forward the agreements as soon as I
receive them.
