Here's my bullet on the regulatory issue:

Section 9.6.  FERC Order.  WNG initially asked to be excused from closing if FERC action undermined the value of the transaction for WNG.  The agreed-upon language excuses WNG from closing only if FERC (1) fails to approve the purchase by and transfer of the assets to WNG, including requested accounting and tax treatment, (2) interferes with WNG's ability to operate the assets or (3) imposes rate regulation on the non-jurisdictional portion of the assets.
