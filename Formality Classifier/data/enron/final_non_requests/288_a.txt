Hi,It was very nice to hear your voice.( I left you another voice mail), here is my contact info so please update your file.  Nothwithstanding the whole mess that we have gone through, I really am pretty good.. lost some money, lost some friends, lost some customers and lost some credability ( that might be the worst part)... sometimes it feels like my last 7 years have been a waste or some would argue a farse.. I truly believe neither is true but it stings once and a while....

Anyways, better save all the stories for when we talk. I look forward to catching up and am hopeful it will be soon. Drop me a reply when you have time, and then leave it to me to contact you soonest.

best regards, BT
