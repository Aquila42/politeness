Hong Kong Chinese New Year Carnival
Hong Kong was a British colony for 100 years until its return to
Chinese rule in 1997, but the handover to communist China doesn't
seem to have damped the city's raging consumerism one bit. Indeed,
bustling Hong Kong still has the best shopping in Asia. But the
city's Chinese roots go deep, which you'll see if you visit during
the traditional wintertime New Year carnival. During this weeklong
festival, Hong Kong residents close out the old and ring in the new
year with parades, fireworks, and more horseracing than you can shake
a stick at. Read More.

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Melbourne
Neighboring Sydney may have the Olympics, but to hear locals tell it,
Melbourne has just about everything else. Melbourne was founded by
the English. But today the city boasts an incredibly diverse ethnic
mix, with immigrants from Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and other Asian
countries rubbing shoulders with a large contingent of European
exiles. You'll find shopping and culture rivaling--some say
exceeding--that of more-traveled Sydney. Throw in the world's best
botanical gardens and the planet's oldest zoo, and you've got a
can't-miss Australian destination. Read more.
http://travelocity1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H1866585973X808635

St. Maarten/St. Martin
Island lore tells us it happened as the result of a land-grab between
a drunken Dutchman and an equally inebriated Frenchman. Whatever the
cause, the result is that quirky St.Maarten/St. Martin is one-half
French and one-half Dutch--although both sides co-exist so peacefully
you can cross from one to the other and never know it. (The fact that
virtually everyone speaks English helps with this effect.) Today the
island is a beach lover's paradise: 37 square miles of land harbor 36
pristine sandy beaches. But shopping and nightlife are also first
class on this unique island, where you'll find the best elements of
the cultures of two European countries. Read More.

Vancouver
Few cities have changed as dramatically in the last 15 years as has
Vancouver, British Columbia. For years Vancouver was a rowdy mill
town too far from the rest of civilization to be much of a tourist
draw. But the area has been dramatically reborn as a thriving,
cosmopolitan city. The explosion of technology companies has had much
to with this. So have Canada's liberal immigration laws, which have
brought waves of entrepreneurial newcomers--mostly from China, but
from all other corners of the world as well. The result is that
today's Vancouver is a true melting pot, where signs advertising
"Chinese-Canadian food" are as common as maple leaves. And should you
tire of the city (you won't), the stunning natural beauty of British
Columbia is just minutes away. Read More.
