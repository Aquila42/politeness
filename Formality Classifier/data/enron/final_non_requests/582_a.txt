Sara,
We spoke with Greg Whiting.  We will not open a futures account for ECT
Investments Inc.  We will only need one account for Enron North America.  We
will internally take care of the allocation to the business.  This avoids
having separate margin balance maintenace.
For products:
Equity: S&P 500, dow and Nasdaq futures
Fixed Income Futures and Options:
Treasuries, euro dollar, bunds, gilts, libor, fed funds, bax, cad 10 yr,
london short sterling, euribor
ECU - 3 month, TSE JGB, EuroYen, etc.
