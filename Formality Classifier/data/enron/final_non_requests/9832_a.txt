In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.  I
think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management
capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the
ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned
that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the
commodity price guarantees.
