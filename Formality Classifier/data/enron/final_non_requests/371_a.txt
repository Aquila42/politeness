Earl and Mansoor,

I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect.  Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also.  Please confirm that you have what you need.  I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed.

Also, I have recieved an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.  I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay it.  Remember, TW is paying for the first $250,000
