FYI - we will probably be asked what historical information is needed in our
shop from a Logistics perspective. I would suggest asking the new CES
employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer
and asset transactions.

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to
the IT folks.

Thanks - Bob
