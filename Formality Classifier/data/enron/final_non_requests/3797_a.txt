The same people may be involved but there are tax savings achieved by passing
all the derivatives through RMT.

Mark -

I am confused on one point:

" If the transaction you are handling is a derivative between ENA and
Australia, it should be documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and
the other between RMT and Australia."

It is my understanding that RMT and ENA are the same 'people'. That being the
case, if we sleeve the RMT to Australia between RMT to ENA, we really haven't
accomplished anything.

A question for you and Sue:

Should we be sleeving RMT to EPMI, a relationship for which we DO HAVE a
Master Agreement in place - if that's where we want the risk to lie.

EPMI and RMT are two different corporations.  As I understand it, in North
America EPMI enters into only physical power transactions with third parties
while ENA enters into financial transactions.  RMT handles financial
transactions between wholly-owned Enron companies.  If the transaction you
are handling is a derivative between ENA and Australia, it should be
documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and the other between RMT
and Australia.  That's why the master agreement is between RMT and
Australia.  I don't know how the booking is handled.

The Enpower ticket shows our Counterparty as Enron Australia  Energy Pty
Limited. We made the leap that it's Enron Australia Finance Energy Pty
Limited, since I sent an e-mail to David Minns yesterday asking him to
anticipate the delivery of the Confirmation. David is the party who is
handling the ISDA MAster Agreement and is awaiting the Confirmation.

The ISDA MAster Agreement is between RMT (as opposed to EPMI) and Enron
Australia Finance Energy Pty Limited. If RMT and EPMI are synonomous (as are
RMT and ENA) then we're done. If they are not, then we have a booking issue
AND a Master Agreement issue.

Perhaps Susan or Mark can help.

I'm starting to hear rumblings that ECT-NA has the deal booked between EPMI
and Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. not Enron Australia Finance.   Who can help
remedy this?
