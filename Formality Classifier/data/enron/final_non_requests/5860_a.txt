It is still the case that we are having real problems in finalizing the ISDA
Master Agreement with Westpac (despite nearly 3 - 4 years of negotiations).
Until the ISDA is agreed, as I have discussed with both Shane and William,
could we please refrain from dealing with them?  We need to send a firm
unified message to Westpac that they need to step up to the plate as far as
the ISDA is concerned.

I will let everyone know as soon as ISDA negotiations are finalized or are
brought to a halt.

Many thanks,

Shari
