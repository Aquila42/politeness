Late breaking good news!  Attached find Rich Hall's testimony on behalf of
PG&E.  It would appear that Mr. Baldwin's extensive lobbying efforts have
paid off here.  Nowhere do I see a specific reference to Hector
Road/Transwestern as another example of the Comprehensive Settlement's
failure to deal with the allocation problem at Wheeler Ridge.  That being
said, I note that the "generic" prescription sponsored by PG&E applies in all
cases where, "the combined capacity of the upstream interconnects exceeds the
downstream take-away capacity."   Anyone paying close attention, or anyone
with an axe to grind here, will be quick to point out that there maybe other
examples similar to Wheeler-- can you say, "Hector Road?"
We'll just have to deal with questions on the application of the generic rule
during the hearings.  I think it good news that PG&E chose not to spell it
out for anyone.  Maybe we owe them one after all?  Thoughts?
