We will need to add/assign this cost to NNG and TW Marketing cost centers under Dave Neubauer (probably Kim's??).  It needs to be included in the Gross O&M and in Project Specific Capital if it is not already (no effect on net O&M).  Then we will assign the amortization expense to the same cost center when we complete the functional earnings statements for Dan's Commercial Group.

It looks like we have a winner.  This will need to be in McCarty' O&M budget.  Who should we advise?  Tracy?
