Hey girlie girl!  Everything at home is great.  Sam & Tony are wonderful.  I'm cooking for a mere 16 people (it doesn't sound like very many now!) for Thanksgiving.  Half of Tony's family will be here.  We won't be up for Christmas (it's our every other year).  Anthony, Andrew & Melissa are with us this week through Thursday afternoon, so we're getting a little extra time with them.  It's the onset of the "teen years", so they're fun, but strange =)  Sam is such a good boy.  He did all the grocery shopping with me yesterday.  He's really good at the store at this age.  He just likes to ride and look and hold the fruits and vegetables - I hope this isn't a sign of some future obsession =)  We also typically have to open a box of his favorite crackers for a snack on the way & possibly a bottle of water.  (All those crackers make him thirsty!)
