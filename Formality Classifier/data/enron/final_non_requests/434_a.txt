I am aware that promotions were available during this difficult transition time.  I am very dissapointed that I did not receive a promotion this year.  I understand that the process was very different and in light of the company situation it would have probably too much to expect.

I feel that I worked very hard building the Renewable Energy Program, Curve Scrub Down, and particularily since the bankruptcy filing.  I personally feel that I have been treated worse than individuals who are very vocal.  I am not that type of person and will not do those type of things to better myself.  I feel that I have worked very hard and have been looked at as a "go to person".  I was the only surviving member of the power desk and have continued to work very hard during the difficult time period since early December 2001.
