Have turned in these names.  Pretty sure these seats will come through, but as always, things can still change.   I need you to place names in spaces for me.  I have a color copy of the seating chart.  If you have 5 minutes to drop by - sometime between 4 and 5 today? - I can show you where your group will be.  First move to the new building is planned for end of September - 3rd floor.  Move to the 4th floor should be two weeks after that.  --Sally
