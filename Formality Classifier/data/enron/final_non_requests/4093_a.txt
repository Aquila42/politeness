First,  Scott is having a wine tasting (Australian) this Wednesday at
Galleria Ruggles.  I don't yet know the cost, but thought one or both of you
might be interested in coming.  I am going this time, and I think Hollis is
too.  Might be fun.  It is not a full dinner, just wines and appetizer type
stuff.
Second;  Mark
