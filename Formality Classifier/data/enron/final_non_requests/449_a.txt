Susan:  I just want to be certain that we are clear when we use the term "logistics".  We have traditionally called our gas scheduling function our logistics function, while I believe the UBS reference to logistics is more generic and relates to a number of functions that support trading activities.  The gas schedulers have quite a bit of external contact, both with our customers and with our gas pipelines on which we reply for transport of our physical commodity.

Bob may be okay with no title for non-officers.  With the degree of external contact that his team has, does it make sense for non-officers to have something on their cards that is a little less generic than "Operations"?  Maybe "Gas Scheduling Operations" or "Operations - Gas Logistics" ?  --Sally
