Hey Jim. How is everything going? Things have been kind of interesting around here lately as Enron is probably going to file for bankruptcy or renegotiate the merger deal it is working on with Dynegy. I'm not sure what it all means for me so I just take each day at a time.

I was searching through the internet (in my off-work time of course) and noticed that the price of YSR50s has really gone up. Do you still have yours? The price of one like yours is probably $2500 to $3000 now.
