Subject: Re: new hub product descriptions - FINAL PROPOSED VERSION

Attached below is the product description for the new Nat Gas Phy Park and
Loan product type.  Commercial is planning on launching this next Wednesday.
I'm not sure if you would consider this just another Nat Gas phy product or
if it requires special treatment.
Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks!!!
