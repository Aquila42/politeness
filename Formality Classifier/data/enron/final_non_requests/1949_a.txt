Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of
Corporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is
reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.

What,s Different?
Your +home, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice.
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules
of SAP.

Any earnings descriptions that start with a +P, represent earning types
reported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for
the July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay
advice as +PVacation,.

Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will
remain itemized in the deduction section.

If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year)to-date
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year
will reflect your earnings by company).

For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick
day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the
related dollar amount will be included in the +Salary, earnings type.
