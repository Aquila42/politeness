Phil, please add $10,334.67 as a payment to be made to Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc. (aka Louis Dreyfus) with the payment set to go out on Friday.

Doug, Drew, I have not generated a cash request in over a month and I know how you guys like to change the cash request process every couple of weeks.
