I will be on vacation from 12/21 to 12/27 and will back in on Tuesday,
12/28.  I have discussed the contents of the credit worksheets for the
physical and financial contracts with Stuart Zisman and Sara Shackleton,
respectively.  Should there be any further credit issues/concerns, please
direct them to Pat Cini (x5-7130) or Bill Bradford (x3-3831) in credit.  I
have informed Pat Cini of the status of both contracts and the relating
credit provisions for each.

Regards,
Tracy
