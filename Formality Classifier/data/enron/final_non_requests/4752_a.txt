I refer to your reply to Raymond's questions.
Please note that the legal survey done to date contemplates transactions
between off shore Enron affiliates and on shore Korean counterparties settled
in US dollars. We have to date not done any legal survey on on shore/on shore
transactions or transactions settled in Won. I have since spoken with Kim &
Chang who ahve indicated that they are not able to opine without research on
whether a on shore / on shore transaction does not require reporting/approval
(albeit not FX related). Kim & Chang will check on this preliminary point and
try to revert to me before our Friday call.
Please feel free to call me if you wish to discuss.
Thanks
Matt
