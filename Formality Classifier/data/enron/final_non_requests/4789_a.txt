I may not understand the question, but Legal does not need to be informed of
each ETA that is executed.

Subject: EOL Contractual Relationships

Please confirm whether legal does or does not require Global to track
contractual relationships with counterparties where an Electronic Trading
Agreement exists but there are no Online GTC's.

Thank you,
