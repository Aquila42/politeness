Carol St Clair has confirmed for me that the GTC does not contemplate a
'Correction for Prices'. John Suarez states that corrected prices must be
'flagged' by the ISO with 75 minutes of publication and must be changed
within 5 days. Since the GTC doesn't contemplate the issue and the mechanism
is different from ISDA,  I have added some suggested language to the Index,
as we should contemplate this issue in the Long Description.

My apologies for not having the attachment included in my last e-mail.
