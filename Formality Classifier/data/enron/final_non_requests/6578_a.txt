I believe we should back Massey as well.  Who do we weigh in with now?

Steve/Rick/Jim  ---  Talked to John Anderson yesterday.  He had just gotten
off the phone with Massey.  Massey believes Linda B.  is spending time at the
White House lobbying to be Chair.   Have we decided whether to back either
and if so which?  I would prefer backing Massey.  Thoughts?   JOE
