According to Bruce Mills in our group,

We have contacted Merrill Lynch Captial Services to retrieve our outstanding
confirms.

They have indicated that they want the fixed price (nymex) language changed
to reflect
"floating" price language and wants all deals which we are confirming changed
immediately
and refaxed to them.

Please advise,

David
