I have forwarded the maps to our agency, and they will incorporate the maps
into our prototype site to be completed by June 5.  These high level maps are
excellent.  I'm sure visitors would want more maps, but that seems more
appropriate to each pipeline's site than the high enron.com level.
On the phone numbers, please provide whatever contact information you
have--but please make sure it is a stable, persistent number.  ENA has
provided us with five 800 numbers they use for info & trading of
commodities.  If you have something similar, please let me know and we will
add it to you content in a prominent location.

Subject: Maps for Enron.com

I know Kevin forwarded you a map showing all the pipelines.  I have also been
working with Maria Salazar to get maps and more details.  The following
e-mail is the last that was sent on this issue.  I think most people like
Kevin's map for formatting, but it will need to be reviewed and maybe
corrected before it is used.  Maria's may be used to provide more individual
pipeline details.

I reviewed the latest draft with the management in ET&S marketing, and two
additional issues came up.  One is that ET&S would like a contact phone
number to appear very early in the screens when someone is clicking onto
Enron.com.  I know that you would eventually get the numbers on our
individual sites with contact numbers, but I think we want a phone number
much earlier....in the first few screens that would appear...maybe on the
overall GPG page.

The other issue is the ability to know the number of hits on different sites,
and to know how much time people spend at individual sites.  Will the site be
set up to track this type of info?  It would be very helpful from the
perspective of knowing how this site works for customers (i.e how long
customers spend on the site, and how "deep" customers go into the website).

Let me know!!!
Thanks.
