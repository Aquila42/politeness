I guess this is good news unless they introduce the "next steps" section at
the meeting with a slide that is titled "Step One:  Shutting Your Sorry-Ass
Pipeline Down ONce and For All" .   Seriously, the agenda doesn't seem to
have any flavor of escalation, which is great given the  lack of attractive
alternatives for our team right now.  Talk to you about this tomorrow.  DF
