Hello Everyone,

Per John Suttle, we are to use the same credit worksheet and attach the same
assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine to the confirmations of the
below deals.

Our customers are waiting for our confirms so if we can put Twister(John S.)
and Strata Energy (should have received worksheet from Brad S.) on our
priority list, that would be wonderful.

Thanks,
Sheetal :)
