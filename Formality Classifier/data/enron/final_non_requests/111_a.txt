Please identify and key issues that could present a stumbling block for UBS' energy business.  Thanks.

1.	Question surrounding 85% Financial vs. 15% Physical (will physical contracts that "net" be viewed ok)?
2.	Can UBS utilize Storage?
3.	Can UBS utilize Firm Transportation?
4.	Can UBS utilize Park & Lend services?
5.	Can UBS utilize ISO marketplaces (given unmanageable credit risk)?
6.	Canadian corporation structure (including question about who does US-Canada export/import work)?
7.
