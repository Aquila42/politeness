All:  I know that AFAC is busy with Enron matters.  However, I received this
response from him on Monday (yesterday).  I have not spoken with either AFAC
or Marcelo but it appears that they are very close to at least a "first
draft".  My thought is that we review the response and identify specific
areas and/or issues for refinement and then schedule a meeting in S.P.  I'll
advise as soon as I hear further.  Sara
