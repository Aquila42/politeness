Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.  I'll coordinate
through QD.

Hi Mark -

Julia Deans from the QD Singapore office  got in touch with me this morning.
Apparently Warren is in Tokyo on a work assignment until February so it won't
be so easy to meet up with him as we'd hoped.  Warren  offered to  try and
fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd
have to confer with you first when Houston opens today.  However,  following
that conversation, Julia's note (see below)  came in.

Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes
far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell
Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend.

I will forward Warren's academic details to you upon receipt from Julia.

Thanks,
Anita
