I am not responsible for THIS Tribasa mess.  My responsibility ended when
Tribasa IV was signed.
Buenas suerte,

Subject: Letter to Republic National Bank of New York (Mexico) S

In retrospect, I apologize for not contacting Ms. Mann earlier (my former
colleague who is responsible for this Tribasa mess) for she indeed did
confront the issue that we are confronting.  Based on the attachment below
and the other emails I am forwarding you, it appears that our procedure for
accelerating EECC's payment rights will be to issue a letter to Republic Bank
who will then issue a default letter to Tribasa and then based on that we can
then issue a demand to AI.  If Ms. Mann so desires, she is welcome to
participate in our 2:45 conference call, by rsvping through email.
