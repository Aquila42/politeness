Hi Vince,
I have sent a mail to Andreas with a full list of all the assumed units
within our model. He has sent some historical
data for cocoa beans and noticed that they were being quoted in GBP/mt so
even currency units seem to be important.
Thank you for pointing this out,
Kirstee

Hi Kirstee,

Thanks again for all your work on MG. One think to double check is units.
Please, make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions
come in.

One potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing
with different
cultures (metric system vs. English measures).

Subject: VaR for COB 2nd Aug 2000

Hi Vince,
I was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the
full mailing list. Basically it suggests that the
copper option position may well have increased the VaR by more than $500,000.
However, given that the portfoilo has also
changed from the 1st of August it is difficult to asses the actual change due
to the option only.
Regards
Kirstee
