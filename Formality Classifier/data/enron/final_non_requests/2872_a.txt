Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit
worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature
here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol
isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a
non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little
written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is
because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this
master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?  Sara
