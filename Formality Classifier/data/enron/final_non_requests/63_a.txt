Monte,

Please scrub the prompt tab, phys index tab, fin index tab, and consolidated tab.  Make sure they all tie out to the hedge strips and sitara.  Shannon will give you a copy of my physical volumes from sitara.

Shannon,

Please run a new copy of all DEC positions for IM WC CAL and gice it to Monte Jones.
