Vince & Stinson,
Just wanted to let you know that I had sent this e-mail below to Ms. Geman
last Friday and have not heard back from her.  I'm sure she is very busy -
but just wanted you to know that I am waiting on a response from her.
In the meantime, I did a couple of things:
1.  I checked with Global Strategic Sourcing's attorney just for her input
and opinion on having Ms. Geman's attorney hold the software in escrow and
she said it would depend on whether it was a U.S. attorney and that we would
probably need to get more information on the attorney.  So, I had sent these
questions as listed below on to Ms. Geman.
2.  I checked into the cost of an escrow agreement with a company that  Enron
has previously used for software escrow.  The company is called DSI
Technology and they have different plans depending on our needs.  I briefly
told DSI what we would probably need, and based on your need of having an
agreement with a release condition whereby DSI would release the source code
to Enron under certain conditions, it would have a cost of about $2,400 for
the first year.  This would allow storage space for about 12 CD's.  All three
parties:  DSI, Enron, and D-G Energy would have to sign such agreement.
However, we would have to work out some special details on releasing the
source code because normally DSI will only release if DSI gave them notice
that they could release it or if certain conditions were met (such as D-G
Energy went bankrupt).
I did not send any of this information on to Ms. Geman - I want to see how
she responds first.  However, I wanted to go ahead and let you know this
since it is about $1,400 more than you had said you would be willing to pay.
Do you have any input on this?
