The Transaction must get papered whether its GTC's or a Deemed ISDA.  The
convention in the physical world (as I understand it) is that the seller
sends its paper.  SS

Tracy - since I 'm in class today and tomorrow will you find out what John's
up to and circle back with Sara?  The deal should be papered as ENA.  Sara, I
cannot imagine why we need a Deemed ISDA for a two day deal....if John
indicates plans for additional deals, we may want to pursue, but I don't
think its necessary at this point.
