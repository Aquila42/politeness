Well, let me think about it a bit more, but what I know at this point is:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.
Your method sounds like a reasonable way to calculate it (though they'll likely want to count a few more beans and haggle before agreeing).
