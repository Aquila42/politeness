Jeff,
Sorry I've been hard to get a hold of... we held a workshop today to talk
about our proposed Transport Options program.  I found a copy of what I'd
sent to you before.  I'll stand behind these numbers today as representing
the dollar value of the risk Transwestern faced in the proceeding.  What's
not clear from my original note is that these cost impacts were annual, and
such impacts would continue year to year thereafter until
conditions/circumstances changed.  I hope this is useful.
