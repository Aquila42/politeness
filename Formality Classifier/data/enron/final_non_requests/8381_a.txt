awww mannnn!!!!!
It seemed like a lot of stuff hit the fan on Friday. Not only there, but
here also.  It didn't hit me initially, but I got caught in some of the
backlash. I hope that your job is NOT in jeopardy. As for the changes. I can
go along with one of them. Guess which. The 8 - 5pm. I'll definitely be
changing to get off at 5pm or earlier. Oh watch your ego.  Its not all you.
I got a letter from Brian's Football team.  They have an equipment check
Saturday July 29 and practice starts that Monday at 6pm.  Being an Assistant
Coach, you know the drill.
As for this other nonsense about phone call/e-mail. If it ain't bad enough
that things.............Oh well. Do you feel me? #@$%*&*# Anyway, not
knowing the full extent what and why it happened (Your Blow Up) and my ever
evolving situation with a new twist.

I think I've said enough for now.
