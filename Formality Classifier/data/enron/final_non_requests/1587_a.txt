Deal #157288
Location: Centana
Days:  3/11-3/31 (gas is not a part of the exchange agreement).

I need to have the spot deal placed on a different deal ticket than the
exchange deal (#157288).
Will you break out this spot deal separately?



Thanks for fixing the price for the ETXG gas system in March.

Daren-
Have you had a chance to change the pricing in the system?
Duke has called me several times they want to get our March deals finalized.
I am not sure what I should tell them.
Thanks-
