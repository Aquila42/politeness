This issue still has not been resolved, and it is effecting  the PG&E
contract 5095-037, HPLC transport contract TA99-027, several deals on the
interconnect report, and causing payment issues for Katherine Herrera to
PanEnergy Marketing.  I have sent several emails, faxed the daily's and left
voice messages, but have not received any updates to this issue.
