We asked for some advice from Baker Mackenzie as to an legal rquirements,
consents permits which may be requred for us to trade aluminium in Japan
using EOL. I also asked them to provde advice on what would be required if we
were to trade metal derivatives. Whilst the advice is not complete I thought
you might find it interesting.
