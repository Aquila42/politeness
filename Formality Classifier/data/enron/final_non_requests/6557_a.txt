As you are aware, the performance management process has been modified to
better focus on the objective of getting/giving feedback and establishing
development and performance goals.

To ensure a successful mid year process, a workshop has been developed to
introduce the changes and train you on the process.  It is critical that you
make every effort to attend the workshop.  The session will cover:
Performance management process and forms
The employee,s and supervisor,s responsibilities, and
Instructions on how to use the automated performance management system

The Houston training will be held at the Doubletree Hotel from June 18 - 25,
1999.  Each session is 2 hours.  The schedule for the non-Houston-based
training will follow shortly.

You can sign-up for the session of your choice through the ECT Development
Center &Ernie8 under the Performance Management category.  If you do not have
