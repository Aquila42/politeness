To follow up on our phone conversation this morning...you had found an additional 4,514 MMbtu/day of West Texas receipts available during the months of 11/02, 12/02, 01/03, and 02/03.  Let's allocate this to the remaining 2 shippers still looking for West Texas supply.  Please allocate on the administrative contract as follows:  2,000 will go to PP&L (they will now have everything they need from West Texas) and 2,514 allocated to Calpine (they will also now have everything they need).  Paperwork is forthcoming.  I believe these will be the last amendments prior to flow.  Thanks.
