The report of my absence is premature - I will be in our South American
offices Mon. - Thurs. of next week but am in the office in Houston all of
this week.

I am also not aware of any memoranda on point.  I have seen the issue
addressed in an off-hand way in one or more articles (not really legal
analysis) and will keep my eyes open for those.  The bottom line is usually
that insurance requires an actual loss and proof of that loss before a claim
can be made on the insurance while in the case of the derivative, no loss
needs to be shown, only the actual weather conditions described in the
agreement.
