Susan, Thank you I had not seen EPNG's response. Comments The change from
2230 mmcfd to 2080 ,OK; The comment concerning k/m meter capacity not
relevant and self serving; delete ; the comment that EPNG shippers hold 1466
firm to "topock" , curious, is this somehow FERC related? Does this confirm
EPNG oversold Topock? ;Schematic at Topock ,tolerable ;Schematic at Hector ,
unacceptable, Mojave from South Needles should be 350 mmcfd  We should
probably discuss our CSA response. Give me a call , Mark , IGS
