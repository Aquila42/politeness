COMELEC Accts	  7


MECO - MECO has processed 55 accounts, based on rejection by EEMC via special meter reads; MECO responsible for ISO charges upon expiration of the ten business day objection period (approximately February 28th).  There is apparantely one account which MECO still has EEMC as the supplier of record; working with Harry Kingerski and Shelly Stubbs to determine if it was rejected.

BECO - Harry Kingerski has had several calls with BECO; it appears that BECO is currently comparing their list of EEMC customers to the rejection list and woking on swithover details.  BECO personnel have been very cooperative and we expect the switchovers to be accomplished very soon.  As in the case with MECO above BECO will be responsible for ISO charges upon expiration of the ten business day objection period (approximately February 28th).

COMELEC - There were no COMELEC accounts that were being physically served by EEMC.
