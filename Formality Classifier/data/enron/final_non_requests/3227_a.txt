This e-mail was mistakely sent to the "other" Mark Schroeder in Omaha.  In
any event, given our discussion yesterday, do we really want to be jumping
through hoops for this Indonesian gas firm.  Jane Wilson did mention to me
yesterday that we were pursuing a JV.  Is that off or likely to be put off,
given our narrowed focus in Asia/Southeast Asia?   thanks  mcs
