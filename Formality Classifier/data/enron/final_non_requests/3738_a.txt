As you know, Enron,s United Way 2000 Campaign ends on Friday, August 25.

Each year the campaign has two goals: to reach a financial goal as well as
reach 100% participation.  ENA's results to date are as follows:

Participation = 76.20% (1,156 out of 1,517 employees)
Financial = $647,651.00 (ENA's goal was $508,200.00)

While we are pleased with the significant improvements from last year's
campaign when ENA had the lowest participation rate in Enron and we did not
reach our financial goal, we are still shooting for 100% participation.  We
still need you!

Please log on to http://unitedway.enron.com or go directly to Internet
Explorer or Netscape and type in unitedway.enron.com.  You can choose to
participate with a contribution, which 1,156 of your fellow employees chose,
or you can choose no contribution, which 116 of your fellow employees chose.
It's up to you.

If you have any difficulties, please contact Kathie Grabstald at ext.
