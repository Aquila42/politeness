We'll be finalising these this week over here with a view to implementing
them among the credit trading group in London.
As discussed, it makes sense to have the same (or virtually the same)
procedures in Houston to ensure that confidential information is handled
uniformly for this purpose.
Please let me have your comments on the procedures (if any) by the end of the
week, if possible.
Many thanks
Paul
PS I assume you're comfortable with S&C's work on the US GTCs whichare now
almost finalised - I'll send through final versions
