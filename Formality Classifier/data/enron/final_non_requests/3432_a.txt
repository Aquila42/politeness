Carol,

I have been working with Mexican tax counsel regarding the online issues and
received written advice from them yesterday, which I'll summarize and provide
to all of you ASAP.  Best regards.

Jaime:
Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed
with respect to the online and offline transactions?
