Anita,

There is a delivery nom of 22 @ the above mentioned meter for 1/99
production.  This is a receipt meter.

Can you please explain the purpose of this delivery nom being @ this receipt
meter?  I also have the same situation @ 98-2662 for 1/99.  Also, this
activity is continuing on into 2/99.

Clem Cernosek expressed that these delivery noms are causing errors on his
end of the spectrum.
