If you want, I can put an ad for your ysr on a site just for those bikes. I will need to know the year, miles, condition, does it have a title etc.

I am still seeing Tracy. She went to Dallas for Thanksgiving but was back for the weekend.

Jeanie had wanted me to loan her another $2500 so she could buy the car she had bid on and was supposedly going to turn around and sell for a huge profit and pay me back the $2500 and the other $3000 I lent her. I told her I didn't have the money but somehow she came up with it. I think mom said Jeanie sold the car but I I don't know what happened to all the profit but Jeanie did send me a check for $75 (I think there were a few zeroes missing).
