Kay,
Below are the prices as well as the ex-work factory dates (ship dates).  As
Ben
and Frank and I discussed last Friday this is what we need the option
extension
to the 30th of June to reflect.  Please give me a call when you can.  We need
to
get this done this PM if at all possible.  Frank and I will both be out of our
offices for the rest of the week and this will get very difficult.

Thanks

MIIKE
