Jim et al:
Based on our experience with PG&E's refusal to accept the data from a
customer-owned meter for calculating the cogen payments (ie. SJSU), we need
to defer the Santa Cruz meter installation.
I will need to get a 'read' from PG&E before we waste any of the UCSC's
money.
I have asked Jeff Dasovich to include this issue in his Rule 21 and 22
arguments before the CPUC. More fireworks to follow. Dirk
