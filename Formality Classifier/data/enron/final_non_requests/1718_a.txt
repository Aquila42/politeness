The spectrononline problem.
From initial IT investigation, it appears the domain name is owned by a
trader at Alliance Gas.  We have had no knowledge of this until one of our
power traders
found out yesterday.
Please could you advise if we need to do anything (eg notify Spectron ,
contact the IT resource we located on the web.
Thanks
Louise
