Background
The East Desk has a long term deal (through March 2007) where we get 35,000/day plus fuel at Iroq Waddington.  We have transport on Iroq and Tenn and the primary delivery points on Tenn are the Boston Citygate and Algon/Mendon.  The transport demand charges are (hopefully) paid by Boston Gas and the Calgary office.

Problem
It appears that the supply at Waddington is coming to the desk at the Tetco M3 mid at Waddington.
