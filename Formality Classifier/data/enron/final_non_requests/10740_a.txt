Mark-
The commercial folks here are anxiously awaiting the final approval of the
Japanese ISDA documentation for IBJ, Mitsui, and Sanwa.  There are deals on
the horizon and we need to have our documentation in order.
Please respond as soon as possible.  I'll try contacting you Tuesday at
6:00 p.m Houston time.
Susan-
Please provide your response regarding tax matters, as soon as possible.
Thanks,
