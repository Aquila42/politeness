Sorry for the delay in getting back with you.  This has been a wild week and a half - end of school activities for the children, birthdays of both of my daughters and at work a move to a different floor, one full day offsite meeting and all of the details around the sale of our intrastate pipeline completed May 31.  I have commitments for a business dinner on Wednesday, June 6th (moved from the 29th this week, the rescheduling of which had a bearing on my availability next week). Patti said that you asked about dinner on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  Coorindating with the home schedule, it looks as if Thursday would be the better evening for dinner, if you are still planning to be in Houston.  I will be leaving the office shortly to drive to Austin - 50th anniversary celebration for my parents.  Patti will be in this afternoon and I will ask her to talk with you to see if Thursday, June 7 works for your schedule.  --Sally
