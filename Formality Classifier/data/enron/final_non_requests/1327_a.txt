Stacy:
I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we
need to do 2 things to the existing language:
1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's
Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is "Exposure".
2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of
subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.
We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the
draft that we send out.
