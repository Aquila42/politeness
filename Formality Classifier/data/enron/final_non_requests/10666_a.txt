Rich - Dave and I were just discussing whether a period less than 12 months
would be appropriate (see language below), given that dereg. may bring some
changes we want to take advantage of.  It's basically your call:  if SPS were
to terminate our contract, how much time would we need to negotiate a
replacement?
