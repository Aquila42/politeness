Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Be happy to discuss further.

Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Republican head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs)
He just about never saw a pro-utility bill he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically locked competition out.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti went along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed, he didn't lead--other members on the committee led.
