My comments pertain to page 2 of the chart under section C.4
referring to increasing the cashout prices to 75% and 125%.  I recommend a
few changes.  First the chart makes a reference to increasing Tier II
cashout prices under the Content Column.  This should be changed to Tier I
cashout prices consistent with the OFO settlement.  Second, it may be
appropriate to provide some additional details on this issue in the Change
to Gas Accord column.  One option is something along the following lines:
"None.  This change is consistent with the Gas Accord provision which allows
PG&E to file to revise imbalance charges and cash-out options.  The current
Tier I cashout prices do not provide an economic disincentive for incurring
cash-out imbalances in all months as intended in the Gas Accord.  This can
serve as a factor contributing to pipeline OFOs.  The change to the Tier I
cash-out prices is consistent with the intent of the Gas Accord, and the
objective to reduce pipeline OFO's."
