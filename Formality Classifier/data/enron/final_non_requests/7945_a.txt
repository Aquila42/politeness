Mark Taylor has asked me to respond to your email.
The NYMEX considers the trades of ENA and its two other principal trading
affiliates (Enron Canada and Enron London), as well as any other affiliates,
to be one and the same as ENA.   The Annual Hedge Exemption applications
require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents
have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any other
related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with
another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.as indicated in the
original email from Mark.   In order to make this representation we need to
do due duligence to establish whether our employees have any such accounts,
and if they have such an account, whether having so might raise any concerns
with the NYMEX.
This annual email has a secondary helpful control purpose.  It fleshes out
the trading of employees that might be in violation of the Company's Trading
Policy.   The Trading Policy prohibits Enron employees from trading any
products that the company trades.
