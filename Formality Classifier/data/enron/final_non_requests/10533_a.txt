Bennett Kaufman forwarded these e-mails to ENA Legal on 11/3/99.  In order to
open the brokerage account, we need (1) authorizing resolutions, (2)
"authorized trader list" and (3) executed brokerage agreement.
PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED MEMO FOR INSTRUCTIONS.
We cannot find EIGHL on the Corporate Workbook and are therefore unable to
proceed further.  We await your immediate response.
