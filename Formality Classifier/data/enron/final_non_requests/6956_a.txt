Very good question - while you don't need to worry about otc swaps, otc
options might be a problem.  However, if the customer is not a US entity, the
advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or
options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there
would be a problem.

Thanks for the response.  Does the term "futures contract" also include
bilateral swaps (or it restricted to exchange-traded futures) and will it
make any difference if the couterparty/customer is a non-US entity?!
