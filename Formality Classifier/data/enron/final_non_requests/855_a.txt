Re: CRE Resolution Encouraging the Use of Financially Settled Commodity
Derivatives Transactions For Natural Gas Prices
.





The Energy Regulatory Commission (Comisin Reguladora de Energa) (&CRE8),
published last Wednesday in the Federal Register a resolution by means of
which the CRE encourages the use of financially settled commodity derivatives
transactions (&Financial Instruments8) to hedge the risk of the natural gas
price variations in Mexico (the &CRE Resolution8). Over-the-counter Financial
Instruments transactions are being enticed by the CRE in light of the surge
of natural gas prices[1]. It is expected that such derivatives market will be
expanded to other type of energy commodities, such as electric power.



Essentially, the CRE is encouraging the use of Financial Instruments by
giving a discount of the price index applicable for the month of August, 2000.



The CRE Resolution provides in general terms that:



1. The Mexican Users[2] that are able to sign a Financial Instrument with
Pemex-Gas y Petroqumica Bsica (&PGPB8), or with any third party, before
September 1, 2000, covering commodity prices fluctuations for the period of
September 2000 thru February 2001, will benefit from a factor of at least
0.75, which will be applied to the price of reference (i.e. $3.705 U.S.
Dollars per MMBtu), which results in a price of $2.7788 U.S. Dollars per
MMBtu, only during the month of August, 2000 (the &Discount Factor8).



2.Mexico,s Local Distribution Companies (&LDCs8), that have
contracted Financial Instruments for their clients, shall passthrough to the
Users the benefits resulting from the Discount Factor, only if such end users
have previously agreed upon the rendering of such services.



3. Needless to say, the price determination for the period of
September 2000, thru February 2001, will be freely agreed upon between seller
of the Financial Instruments, and the User or the LDC, as the case may be.






Very truly yours,
