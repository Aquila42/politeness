Subject: Yesterday's discussion

Read JB's response to my phone call below.  I'm not sure what's going on but
if you read the info I had sent to you (via intercompany mail), there are a
number of questions which are relevant:
Why does M. Panelo's e-mail reference JB's ownership being 33%?
Why is JB's signature on the MOU Amendment?  What is his authority as a
signatory?  If he's not an officer of this "Ecogas S.A." then why is his
signature evidenced?
We're trying to track down the faxes he referenced below.  Once received,
I'll forward them if they're pertinent.
RTM
