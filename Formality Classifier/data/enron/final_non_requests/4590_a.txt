Please read the attached correspondence from Brent regarding the controls and
standards we have been discussing.  Daren, I realize you will not be able to
attend the morning meeting due to trading.  However, Pat, I would like for
you to attend to represent the Gas Logistics role.  Please ensure you and
Daren have met prior to the meeting, and you are prepared to represent this
functional area.  Thanks.
