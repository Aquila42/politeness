Mark:

Pursuant to our conversation today, we would appreciate your thoughts on the
attached advice and whether it is too "risky" for us to proceed using Enron
Japan as the counterparty for weather derivatives in light of how we have
assessed the risk in other jurisdictions regarding weather derivatives. I
will also being forwarding to you the June 13 e-mail advice mentioned in the
attached memo. The referenced January 14, 2000 memorandum is quite lengthy,
but I can forward to you by e-mail if you would like. Let me know what you
think as soon as you can; sometime this week would be very helpful. Thanks a
lot.

Alan
