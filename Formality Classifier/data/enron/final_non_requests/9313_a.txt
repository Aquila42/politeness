Hi Vince, Scott Pleus (listed below in the director promotion section) is
bandwidth-trading backoffice person we,ve been working with.  I have known
Scott from EBS since he and I started around the same time. In fact, I was
one of the first people to talk to Sally Beck about booking some of our
network positions*at which time I met Scott.   I know we have discussed this
matter many times before, but this is a specific example of how people at all
functional areas are benefiting from EBS' rapid 'growth.'  Scott has been at
Enron for about the same time I have been. He came from another energy
company's backoffice before that.

As for my specific situation, after our discussion yesterday, I understand
clearly what happened. It appears bad luck had a lot to do with it!!!

Thanks for looking into the promotion in the first place and I am certain
that you'll push the promotion through at the earliest convenience of the HR
folks!

Kind Regards,

Ravi.
