Kelly,

I have already replied regarding the BOD of directors meeting, but am using this message to request board minutes from you.

FYI:	As the Junior League's Outside Board Rep to the Foundation - I must provide on a quarterly basis "Minutes of the Foundation's Board of Directors Meetings".  Pat usually provides a copy of the last BOD minutes in the current meeting's director packet.  However, those minutes are for approval and therefore unexecuted.

In order to provide a copy of the "official" BOD minutes they must be executed.  Therefore,please fax to my attention (fax #(713) 646-3490) a copy of the executed minutes for the BOD meetings, which occurred during the 3rd & 4th quarter of 2001, as follows:
