PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL
Please see the request that was made by the Navajo EPA to Larry Campbell (one
of our New Mexico Division Environmental Specialists) below.  The Navajo EPA
has no jurisdiction over pipeline safety and there is a serious question as
to whether the  expertise exists within the Navajo EPA to interpret the
corrosion records we keep.
Dave Johnson and John Shafer have advised the lads to funnel this request and
similar requests through our p/l safety group, legal and the VP of Operations
and be extermely careful in our responses.  However, this request presents
its own special issues.  I'll speak to John Gormley and ask him to say simply
that he will pass the request along.
Rather than respond indiviually, it seems we would wish to coordinate a
response with at least El Paso and Questar.  Thgts??
