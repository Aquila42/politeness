Steve - as you will see from below, Mac's weekly report contained below lists
all that he is working on or leading.  Consistent with Terry's point at the
PRC, has has duties that go way beyond government and regulatory affairs
(indeed, when you read through it, I am not sure how he even has time for all
of it).  This is not a complaint, just verification of Terry's point, but
does also suggest that we should think about if his PRC/review is
appropriately within our group or not (what about the group you did the day
before, property services, for example, given his seemingly do-it-all "office
manager" role?).  mcs
