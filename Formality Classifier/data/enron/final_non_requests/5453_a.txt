Mark:  I apologize for not copying you on this message yesterday.   We
received confirmation from Pat Markey yesterday morning that global liquids
will start on-line trading January 5th and that we needed to expedite the
on-line confirmations asap.  In the process of preparing the confirms we
realized that minor changes needed to be made to ELFI and ERAC's GTCs so we
forward them directly to Dale Neuner.  David Forster called me last evening
and I went over the changes to each of the GTCs with him.  He said that he
will make the changes right away so that we will have the revised version
on-line this morning.

Thanks.
Nony
