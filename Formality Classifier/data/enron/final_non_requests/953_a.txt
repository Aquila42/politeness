Yes.  It is almost finished, and I should have it out in a few minutes.

Subject: Enron Term Sheet (DRAFT)

Sara and Jim -
Here is the term sheet for the CSFB forward (this is related to the swap that
we unwound on Friday).  The same old issues of registration and net cash
settlement are in here.  I'd also like to talk to ya'll about the fees and
expenses section.  Jim, where are we on putting together registration
language that is acceptable to us?  Talk to ya'll later.
