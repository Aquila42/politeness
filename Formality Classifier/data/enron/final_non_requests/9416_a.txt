I'm saving this message, by the way.  Your characterization of Omaha may be
worth money someday.

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.
