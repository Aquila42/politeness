FYI -- Ken Lay is coming to D.C. tomorrow to do meetings with the Greater
Houston Partnership on a number of Air Quality issues.  As I thought MTBE
might come up with EPA and some of the Texas members of Congress, I added a
section on MTBE and Enron's activities/position to talking points I produced
for him.   (attachment below)
