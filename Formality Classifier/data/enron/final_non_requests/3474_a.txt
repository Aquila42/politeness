Thanks Carol, I understand you are only focusing on the Online transactions,
and all I ask from you is the clearance to do Online transactions.
Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all the
pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his
view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the
same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are
ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that
happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom
their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning....
I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara.
011-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can
discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.
Thanks and regards.

Jaime:
Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed
with respect to the online and offline transactions?
