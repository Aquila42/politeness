Hello all:

Bad news!  Most of the really nice restaurants in Breckenridge close on the
22nd of April.  We may have to have all the dinners at the hotel.  Do you
have
any other suggestions?

I will check with Scott Yeager's wife again today to see if she perhaps knows
of another good restaurant that may be open, but the owner of Pierre's told
me most of them close and open again for the summer season in  May.

Thanks!

Shirley

Ravi:

Can you answer Shirley's question.  Are you planning to have the entire group
go to dinner, or just senior management?  Please let us know your plan.
