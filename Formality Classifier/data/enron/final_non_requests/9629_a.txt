Hi Darron -

Thank you for response, however we aren't able to send/receive CD's through
the mail for security reasons.

I will try to reach you by phone, so we can make arrangements.

Thanks!
Albernita

I have been in Chigago for the last two weeks.  The CD is in my desk in
Houston.  What is your location?  I can have it sent via intercompany mail.
Sorry about this.
