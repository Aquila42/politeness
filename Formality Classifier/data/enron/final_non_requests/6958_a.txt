Shari / Sara,
See below for Deemed ISDA Confirm produced in London for the first financial
paper OTC Derivative carried out by EEFT for ECTRIC.
You will be receiving from Jeff Harbert a form of ISDA Confirm (produced by
Dale Neuner) to back-off this trade from ECTRIC to Risk Management & Trading
Corp but as you will see there are substantial architectural differences
between the two confirms.
Accordingly, Edmund Cooper and I would like to discuss this issue with either
of you when you are available.
My extension in London is x6552.
Kind regards
