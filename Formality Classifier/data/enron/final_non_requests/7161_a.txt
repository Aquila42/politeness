Attached is the position statement that ECT sent to Mitsubishi today.  Matt,
if you haven't done so already, please consider giving Joe Hirl a call re
this and/or a copy of what we sent, assuming that neither you nor David see a
strategic downside to doing so.  Many thanks.(Deborah, please print out and
file.)
