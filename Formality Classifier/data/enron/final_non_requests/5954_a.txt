FYI-- "E" in the weekly report is the $5 million FERC penalty against Kinder
Morgan (for KN marketing affiliate violations).  You all may know this, but
the FPA has similar penalty provisions for "knowing and willful" violations.
Apparently though, it takes much more than simply winning a complaint (like
Aquila v. Entergy, for example) to get FERC to threaten to refer the case to
the DOJ for penalties.  I was wondering why Commissioner Massey filed the
concurrence in Aquila complaining of the lack of sticks FERC has since it
cannot award damages to the winning party and talked briefly with Dan W about
it.  Perhaps if FERC finds some pattern of behavior in abuses by electric
companies from the new data, it will result in some penalties.
