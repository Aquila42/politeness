Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.

IAS  <== we just created k# A02353
ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262
FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.


Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork
to legal and I need it back by Monday morning.
