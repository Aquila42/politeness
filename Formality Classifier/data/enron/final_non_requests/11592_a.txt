Did you get a copy of this?  It looks as if in September that our
intercompany balances were relatively low (EES and ENA), with an increase in
October with Enron Europe.  Do you have details behind this?  Are EES
balances gas only, or gas and power?  How do we have imbalances with
ourselves?  What kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regular
basis that gives you the details behind this?  I am assuming that these
imbalances are created from commodity transactions, so that we would really
be closer to the details than would financial ops.  Is that a good
assumption?  --Sally
