Sarah,
The Generation Interconnection Agreement will have to be modified to
accommodate the Net Metering law (R.C.W. Chapter 80.60) that was passed
here
in Washington in 1998.  The law covers generators of 25 kW or less that
are
powered by solar, wind, hydro or fuel cells.  Washington distribution
utilities are required to install two-way meters for all customers with
such
facilities and to credit those customers for any power produced in
excess of
the customer's needs.  We are required to accept all qualified net
metering
customers until the total generating capacity of the net metered systems
reaches 0.1 percent of our 1996 peak load.

Because these generators are tiny and, even in the aggregate, are
unlikely
to have any appreciable effect on the operation of the grid, I think the
easiest approach would be simply to write an exemption into the GIA for
such
net metered generators.

I don't know whether any of the other RTO-West states have net metering
laws.  However, net metering has been kicked around quite a bit in
connection with federal restructuring legislation.  Hence, we need to
keep
an eye developments in DC in this regard.
