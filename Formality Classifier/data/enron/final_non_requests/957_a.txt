SMUD is working on a weather transaction with Enron which may get completed
shortly - since this is a financial deal we need to get a ISDA in place
asap.  I believe this is a blacklined copy of the ISDA.  Feel free to call me
or Gary Taylor at 713-853-1511 to get more info on the weather deal.

PS I hope this leads to us getting the power schedule as well!
