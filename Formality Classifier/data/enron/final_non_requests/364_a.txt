Bill,

Here is the I/C agreement for Questar.  We now want to look at the possibility of Questar installing all measurement, DAS facilities and 120 feet of 12" pipe to TW'S specifications.  TW will still install 12" hot tap and side valve.  TW will purchase these facilities that are installed by Questar for $1.  Questar will reimburse TW for hot tap and side valve.

Please call me if you have question.  Thanks, Kim.
