Subject: Depositions in the NSM Case

Richard:

Ahab Garos, a young intern at McDonald during 1997-98, was deposed in New
York this week. We concluded that this particular deposition was not worth
the expense of our attending personally, but we will be obtaining a rough
transcript tomorrow and a final one later. It is unlikely that Garos had any
significant contact with Enron, and Mike Swartz advised us before the
deposition that he did not intend to ask any "Enron questions."

Next week Aaron Izowar of White & Case is being deposed. We think we should
attend that deposition, and Roland is planning on doing so, unless you
disagree. Izowar coordinated a lot of the work in preparing the offering
memorandum and is likely to be asked about Enron's role in that process.
