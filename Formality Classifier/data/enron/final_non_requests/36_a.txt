Dale,

Thanks for the email.  I would be happy to pay the 50.00 fee one last time, however, given that this account will not be touched and no changes in tha accounts holdings are alowed under Canadian tax law, we need to find a way to either aviod this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else.  I would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where I should send the money for the outstanding balance.

Regards,

Jon
