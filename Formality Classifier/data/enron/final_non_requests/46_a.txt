Steve and Teb,

Please find attached the agreement for Questar Southern Trails I/C with TW in the San Juan Hub.  It is very standard, just like the Agave agreement.  Fully reimbuseable.  The location of where we are connecting is jointly owned with our Hub partners, PNM and NWPL, so once this I/C agreement is executed, we will send a notice to the PNM and NWPL asking them if they want to participate in the I/C.  If they do, fine
