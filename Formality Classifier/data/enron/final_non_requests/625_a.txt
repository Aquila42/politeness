Got your voicemail with Carlos' attached, and will be happy to schedule the
interviews for him on Monday and/orTuesday.   Who did you decide he should
interview with?

no, hold all of them until I speak with him -- we've obviously got a lot of
interest!  Michelle

I'll wait to hear from you for all interviews for him--or did you want me to
go ahead and schedule him with Barbara anyway?

Here are others who want to interview Carlos.  I tell you what -- before you
schedule any of these, let me talk with Carlos first to see where his
interests lie.  Keep these names, and I'll keep you posted on who to schedule
with him.  Thanks.  Michelle
