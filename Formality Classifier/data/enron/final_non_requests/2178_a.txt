I have now received SCGC's Motion to Compel. I note that the same
interrogatories that TURN withdrew, SCGC is withdrawing. Therefore, my
original view that we can deal with this without taking up time at the PHC
still stands. I would like you to try to work this out by yourselves based
upon my indication here as to how I will rule.
The bottom line is that SoCalGas must respond to those interrogatories
seeking to clarify which settlement is its first choice. It is by no means
crystal clear, and does impact the breadth of support for each settlement.
(In fact, I'd like to know SDG&E's view on this too.) I think this could be
done in a limited way as opposed to responses to all the interrogatories
comparing the two settlements. Whether SoCalGas has breached the Interim
Settlement by also signing the Comprehensive Settlement is not directly
relevant to this proceeding. I don't need to determine that and I don't want
to expand this already far-ranging proceeding to include that - take it to
court if you want to. Moreover, some of the questions are now moot as all
prepared testimony has been lodged. So, please meet and confer again. If
you can't come to an agreement based on my views in this email, then SoCalGas
should file its Opposition on the 23rd, and I'll rule on each interrogatory
on the 25th. Please let me know ASAP if you've worked something out.
