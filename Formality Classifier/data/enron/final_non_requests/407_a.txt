Guys,

I just spoke with John Oh in Portland.  He'll be your reference for help with scraping west data since he's been through it all.  He'll be expecting a call from you guys.  He said he has a number of tips to help you out.  He also said that we should have access to their database today, and within the hour for me.  I'll let you know when I'm in.

Mat
