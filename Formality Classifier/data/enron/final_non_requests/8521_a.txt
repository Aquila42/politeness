Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.
