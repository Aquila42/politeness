What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective
4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a
new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe
that has already been done)?

I was not aware ot the Sonat Style.  In that case, an IT request is not
necessary.
