Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was
dedicated
to retail?

From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small.
