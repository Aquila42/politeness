Subject: California

Jeff-
This is a guy from South Carolina who works with a bunch of industrial
customers there.  At the last GridSouth meeting, he cornered Joe Connor and I
and asked us about California and the price spikes there.  I told him a bunch
of reasons why the price spikes happened, but it appears that he wants more
information.
I would appreciate it if you would call him or if you could find someone else
out there in CA to give him a call.  He is not super sophisticated, but he is
the representative of some big clients, so I try to keep him happy.  [I think
he represents Michelin and Nucor steel--two huge energy users in South
Carolina.]
Thank you very much.
