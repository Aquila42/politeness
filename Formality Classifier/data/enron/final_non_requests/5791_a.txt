Today I received the information relayed below regarding activities at the
Eunice facility.  Judging from the pictures and the description of the work,
there are compelling indications that former operations at the Eunice
facility impacted the property owned by Northern Natural Gas.  Please respond
to the following questions at your earliest convenience:
1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal activities;
2) has the release been stopped and how;
3) has the extent of impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto
NNG's property or down to groundwater; and
4) has the NMOCD been notified.
I am also concerned that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through
NNG's facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked,
particularly the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG
facility near the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains
PSH).  Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.  I suggest we get
together sometime in the near future to discuss this recent information.
