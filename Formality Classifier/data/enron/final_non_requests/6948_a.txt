There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the
internet trading language in the confirm they generate?
