The following comes to mind:

Describe the inputs to VAR and the sources of the inputs
Discuss Enron's timing of running the VAR calculation
Explain the diversification effect
Explain that only Officialized books are included in the VAR calculation
Explain how Enron uses the VAR for risk measurement, portfolio performance
analysis, individual trader analysis
Address Risk Policy limits related to VAR
A comparison of Enron's risk appetite, measured in VAR, vs. other financial
companies would be interesting
How does Enron'e use of VAR as a risk measurement tool compare with our
competitors?
Explain why the VAR engine would have different positions than our benchmark
reports.
Discuss Component VAR
Discuss useful analyses Enron can implement utilizing VAR (Sharpe ratio, VAR
efficiency, etc.)

Hope this helps,
