Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinquish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.

Before we release the funds we would like to get a revised letter from NorthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired.

I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.
