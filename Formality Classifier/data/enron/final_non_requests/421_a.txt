Notwithstanding anything herein that may be interpreted to the contrary, the aggregate Operational Imbalance for all Interconnect Points in any month will be within a 10% tolerance level (i.e., neither exceeds 110% of the quantities scheduled, or is less than 90% of the quantities scheduled).


Bill,
Here is how I currently have paragraph 6 ( the tolorance level) in the OBA.  Should we insert another sentence reemphasizing that "all imbalance" will be "cashed out"?
