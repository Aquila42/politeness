With the attached note, all analysts' estimates posted on First Call are
after the mark-to-market impact.  After third quarter earnings were released,
we told the analysts few transactions would be marked-to-market at year end.
As a result, we would expect mark-to-market to be negative in the fourth
quarter also.

With Dain Rauscher's revisions, the concensus is $0.03 for the fourth quarter
of 1999 and $0.24 for the full year.
