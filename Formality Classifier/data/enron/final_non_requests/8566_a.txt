Barbara,

Attached is the Memorandum Of Agreement referenced in my voicemail to you of
10:15 a.m. today.  The Turbine sale is to be documented by an Asset Purchase
Agreement attached as Exhibit E--it is very vanilla from a Seller's
perspective and should be easy to negotiate into final form.

As mentioned in my voicemail, the only legal issue I have with the Barge Sale
portion of the document is Section 12 (b), the Indemnification Clause which
does not indemnify ENA for third party claims arising out of BargeCo's breach
of the contract.  A reasonable compromise, in my opinion, would be to require
Bargeco to indemnify us against third party claims for which there is no
specifically identified remedy (such as delay damages or MW buydown damages)
in the Memorandum of Agreement.  This would take care of most LIPA risks.

Aside from the foregoing, I'm happy with the document.  Now Ron and Curly
Baca have to come to terms on (i) the 90/10 Price payment timing; (ii) the
$1,000,000 in spares that Ron thought he was buying and (iii) whether the is
a purchase price adjustment if the barges test out at less than 66 MW of
capacity.

Thanks,

Steve
