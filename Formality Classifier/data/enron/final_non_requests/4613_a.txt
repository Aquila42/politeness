That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked
hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we
took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant
real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI
incorporate the write downs we think should occur?
