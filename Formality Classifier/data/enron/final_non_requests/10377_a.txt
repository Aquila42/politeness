Rachel:
Mark Taylor will finalize all issues relating to the EnronOnline Games in my
absence.  Please follow up with Mark to advise re the status of Italy, Norway
and Sweden (and any other countries that we may be able to move to the
"Approved List.")  Also, please confirm that for the purpose of screening
individuals who should not play the game, the appropriate question is
"Country of Residence."
Thank you so much for all of your invaluable assistance on this project!
