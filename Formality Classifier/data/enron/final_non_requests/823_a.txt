Jay,
I think that should be looked at and re-evaluated. The way I had it, AS, PB,
DB and I (we had commercial and IT infrastructure covered in  1 call) all
attended the video calls but I primarily drove the business activities and
co-ordination.  I had envisioned Allan and your group taking over directly
pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities.  I suggest that
all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big
changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the
business opportunities.  I believe they are a great resource for future
development and they really appreciated the communication effort and we
really helped them.

All,

FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and
commentary.  I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org
changes.  I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious
reasons.

Mike
