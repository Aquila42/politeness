Christopher,

I believe Tracy Ngo has begun to look at it from a credit perspective.  I
don' have any of the details.  Aquila Energy Corp. is the guarantor for
Aquila trading subs and is not anywhere near the equivalent credit quality of
Enron Corp.  We need to be careful of how much incremental risk we take with
Aquila without collateral because of our significant trading positions with
them.  Please advise when you find out more details about the structure.

Regards,
Bill
