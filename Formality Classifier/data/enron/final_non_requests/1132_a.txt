The Baytown 12" pigging project scheduled for August 15 has been cancelled.
The work has been rescheduled and is expected to begin September 12.  The
same list of meters will be shut-in early on the morning of September 12 and
remain shut-in approximately three to four days.

If you have any questions please call me 36449.

Thanks
Gary Hanks
