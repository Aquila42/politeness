It is $43.  If you want to go and can fit it into your "rug budget", call
Scott at 524-3397 and he can sign you up!  Mary

The wine tasting sounds great!   I haven't been to one in awhile.  It's
always good to see Hollis too.  Keep me posted...

First,  Scott is having a wine tasting (Australian) this Wednesday at
Galleria Ruggles.  I don't yet know the cost, but thought one or both of you
might be interested in coming.  I am going this time, and I think Hollis is
too.  Might be fun.  It is not a full dinner, just wines and appetizer type
stuff.
Second;  Mark
