The question is; is it actually part of the legal name for the counterparty?
If it's part of the legal name, fine, if it's not, we cannot be incorporating
the state as part of the name in Global Counterparty, since this will not be
the actual legal name.  If the problem is that people are making assumptions
when they see a city or county name, then they will have to investigate a
little further to see if this is really the city or county they want.  The
main problem is that documents are generated from Global Counterparty using
the legal name, such as invoices, payments and confirmations, and there could
be legal implications if we do not have the proper name on the document.

What do think about putting the state in parenthesis after a city's
counterparty name??
