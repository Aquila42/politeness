Sorry, I forgot to answer your last question.  I think its fine to send the
documents out to Hanover.  Even if some of the blanks are not filled in, we
can get their lawyers looking at the structure.  DF

Subject: Hanover / TW Compression Monetization

Drew - Do I need some kind of confidentiality agreement? An attorney present
to discuss at first meeting?

MKM - One questions Jim Gill had was how do we get around FERC requirements -
someone from Regulatory available to discuss at first meeting or.....?

Although we believe the operating agreement and other details are in order, I
hadn't just planned to send them as is to Hanover. Some counseling may be in
order here, as I'm moving into new territory for me......
