Gary,

1. Backup swing - I can live with a two-tiered pricing structure for
no-notice backup swing service. Just for clarification the tiers and pricing
would be as follows:
a) 0 - 20,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel, Midpoint,
two days after flow plus $0.04/MMBtu and,
b) 20,001 - 50,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel,
Midpoint, two days after flow plus $0.10/MMBtu.

2. Firm Gas - The flexibility of the firm gas delivery is for plant
maintenance only. I can drop the maximum volume to 110,000 MMBtu/d but
that's it. Given our current maintenance schedule, the expected demand and
your nominated volume would be as follows:

Month   Deer Park Demand  HPL
Nomination
July 2000  207,000 MMBtu/d  105,000
MMBtu/d
August  207,000   105,000
September  207,000   105,000
October  190,000    95,000
November  210,000   110,000
December  210,000   110,000
January 2001 145,000    70,000
February  165,000    80,000
March   213,000   110,000
April   108,000    50,000
May   108,000    50,000
June   213,000   110,000

If you do the math, the total HPL nomination volume is 33,485,000 MMBtu for
a daily average take of 91,700 MMBtu/d. The uncertainty is that the
maintenance schedule is dynamic and the above numbers are subject to
revision. That's why we need the flexibility.

3. Curtailment/Interruption - My expectation is that this is a firm gas
supply. If I need to curtail and/or interrupt, it would trigger the buyback
option and would count against my annual average. However, if you curtail
and/or interrupt the buyback option would not be trigged and my annual
average would be adjusted accordingly.

4. Nominations - your definition of bidweek is perfectly acceptable. Can I
make a nomination of 105,000 MMBtu/d today?
