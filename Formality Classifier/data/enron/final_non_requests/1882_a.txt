Margaret:
As you can imagine, most information and procedures on the floor are
extremely confidential.  We look at the gas market uniquely and using
different tools than anybody else.  It is one of our competitive advantages.
I'm hesistant to approve the use of any documents for external purposes.
If you provide more information about what you're trying to show, who the
target audience is, and what format it will be presented, I may be able to
help you.
