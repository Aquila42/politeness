This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical
information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14
so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13.

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Thanks - Bob
