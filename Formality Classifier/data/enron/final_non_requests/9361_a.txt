This is gas that was missing from our first of the month volumes. that should
be within our 10% swing.  The scheduler told me there aren't any restrictions
currently and with the additional volumes we would be within our 10% swing.
Either way wouldn't this be billed at gas daily as long as we are not
restricted?

Brian, is this incremental gas?
