Are you aware or should you be aware of this.....

There are several issues with this,  the main one being that we get the
biggest bang for our "gives" to IBM..

It seems the way this is set up,  IBM will piecemeal us and get a lot of work
without a significant "get" for Enron (ie an outsourcing or a bandwidth or
other deal)

Are there IT and Process issues?  Is Sally involved.  Maybe they are
self-contained and none of this is anyone's business.

I would like your thoughts.....
