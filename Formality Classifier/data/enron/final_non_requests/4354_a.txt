Andrea,
The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.  That
red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.  Do you want to choose
another one.  We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may
have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.  Let me know your
choice!
