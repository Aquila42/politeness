Vince,

I've been invited to speak at the conference below in Amsterdam in April.
This is along with the Monte Carlo conference a week later which Stinson has
forwarded my name for. Both are by EPRM, and shouldn't take too much time to
prepare as will be on similar topics to the previous conference at which I
spoke. Should I go to both, or start prioritising these events?

Ben
