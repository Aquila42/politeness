Thanks for the update--Other than the Gallagher Boland $$$ I can't think of
anything that we might be squirreling away and capitalizing.  (Grynberg $$ go
to a work order also, but are expensed, right?).  Also, I absolutely trust
you, but in the Ronald Reagan sense:  "Trust, but verify."  Adios.  DF

DREW - SINCE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON I SPOKE WITH ELAINE.

WE HAVE CAPITAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC PROJECTS - SUCH AS AN
EXPANSION PROJECT.  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE AND I HAVE PROVIDED
MS. PATEL A LIST OF ET&S PROJECTS THAT FIT IN THIS CATEGORY (I ONLY HAD A
COUPLE AS WELL).

THERE COULD BE OTHER CHARGES WHICH ARE ALLOCATED TO A GENERAL OVERHEAD AND
CAPITALIZED.  THE ONLY MATTER THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY WOULD BE THE
GALLAGHER/BOLAND (OUTSIDE COUNSEL) COSTS.  WE HAVE THESE GOING TO A WORK
ORDER FOR THE YEAR 2000 (A TOTAL AMOUNT OF ABOUT $425,000 FOR NORTHERN).  I
BELIEVE WE WERE PLANNING TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS AS THE SAME FOR 2001 AND TREAT
THEM THE SAME (ASSUMING ELAINE AND OTHERS GIVE US THE GO AHEAD).

ELAINE - ANYTHING TO ADD?  ALSO, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE COLLECTING THESE
CHARGES FROM ALL GROUPS AND WILL GET BACK TO US??  (AND YOU WILL PUT ME ON
YOUR DISTRIBUTION LIST SINCE I DON'T TRUST DREW AND HE'S TOO SMART TO TRUST
ME.) THX.
