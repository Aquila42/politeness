Just phoned you but got your voicemail.

As it is just for a long weekend I do not want to fly  for more than 3 hours, I would prefer to stay within a short drive of the airport (less than one hour).    I think Nantucket would be great but I do not think there are any direct flights from Houston and as such it exceeds my three hour limit.

I really want a luxurious hotel, with something to see during the days (eg San Francisco but we have been there)
