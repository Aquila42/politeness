Attached is a draft of the issues list that we discussed at our meeting on
Friday.  This list is intended only to highlight the principal issues to be
addressed in greater detail as the proposal develops, and to assist in
identifying the next steps.  As a result, we have kept this list fairly
general and have not attempted to undertake a full analysis of the issues.
Please call or e-mail with any questions or comments.  Thanks.
