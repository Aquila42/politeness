Thanks for the opportunity.  I'm V.P. and General Counsel of Enron
Transportation and Storage, and its operating companies, Northern Natural Gas
Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co.  I'm stationed in Omaha, Nebraska.  I
practiced law in D.C. for 12 years before FERC and other state and federal
regulatory agencies and the courts.  As for objectives, I'd like to see the
group facilitate dialogue and work toward consistency on regulatory strategy,
as well as serve as a forum for sharing practical "best practices" experience
Enron people have gained around the world.  I look forward to meeting you!

Subject: Introduction

Drew - I talked to Mike Moran this morning and he suggested you for
participation in this corporate working group (see below).  Very glad to have
you.  Other group members are from  various parts of Public Affairs, both
U.S. and International.  Mike also said you may want to have Maria Pavlou
participate, which I leave up to you.  The perspective from the pipeline
group will be a great addition to our effort.

Please see the note below and respond at your earliest convenience.  Thanks
very much.
