Vince:

According to Alex,  Li Xiao gave your email address to Alex.  Did Li Xiao
talk to you first about Alex? I don't know for certain.  Alex contacted you
in March, interviewed once, but nothing came of it.  After Gary left, Li Xiao
suggested to Alex that he try again, and the rest is history.

Grant.
