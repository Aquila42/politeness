Don, in my opinion options 1 & 2 are the same and 3 is not an option.  I
would like to provide an outsourcing deal that earns us fees and provides
information.  We will manage the internal issues.  A properly priced and
scoped term outsourcing deal should be doable.  Please speak with Sally Beck
and Beth Perleman.

Delainey
