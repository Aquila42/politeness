I've completed the July schedule for the Midwest and the Southeast crews.  If anyone in these groups has a complaint about working days during the week, let me know.  By having you guys working during the week, it will be beneficial for us on the day shift and for yourselves.  The first week of the July schedule did not change much.  The rest of July did however.  If you have something scheduled for July and you can't get out of, please do the following, try to switch out with someone and then talk to us if you can't get out of it.  The August schedule will be out shortly.  If I hear enough complaints about the July schedule we can always go back to the original schedule.  Sorry it took so long to get this schedule out.
