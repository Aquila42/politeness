Steve/Daren,

I interviewed this candidate and REALLY liked her.  She has previous
allocations and settlements experience, but really wants to do financial
accounting.  As you will see on her resume, she is doing internal auditing at
Foleys.  She was honest with me that she did not necessarily want to do
allocations again and that she really enjoyed working with the schedulers and
traders, although she doesn't necessarily want to schedule or trade.  She
mentioned Risk specifically.  I think she would be an asset to Enron.  Please
use at your discretion.  Thanks!
