Hi Kim,

My name is Jonathan McKay and I am a former employee of Enron now working for UBS Warbury Energy.  Jeanie Slone gave me your name and said you might be able to help me with some issues regarding documents I need for my international tax returns.  I recently moved from Canada to the US with Enron and now need to file tax returns in both countries.  In order to properly file my tax returns I need to obtain detail information about which stock-options were granted to me, in which countries and at what strikes.  Do you know how I could obtain this information?  Also, I am trying to get a copy of my December 31, 2001 pay stub.  Duw
