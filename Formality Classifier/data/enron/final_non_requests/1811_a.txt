As you know, the ETA has to address Trade one-to-many with Enron and Match
one-to-many with Enron.  We also need a separate Trade GTC one-to-many with
Enron and Separate Match GTC one-to-many with Enron.  We also need a single
Password application that addresses Match and Trade, both one-to-many.
As soon as these drafts are complete, I would like to read them!
Thanks.
