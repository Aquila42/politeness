It is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers,
however, If the pipeline allocates the shortage to ENA then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly.  Just remember that we allowed
makeup  on the 18, 19, & 20th for a total volume of 5K over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4th and part of the 9th.  All other volumes should be
purchased back  per the language in the contract.  Remember they have a
tolerance of 5% below the nomination.
