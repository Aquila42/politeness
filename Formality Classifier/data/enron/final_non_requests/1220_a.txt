Edmund/Shona
I thought either or both of you would be best placed to assist Bob Bruce with
this request.
Would you be kind enough to see what documents we have which may throw some
light on MG's licensed status.
As to whether any licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply
"upward" to any Enron entity, Edmund do you know whether the MG parent
company was so obligated?
Regards,
