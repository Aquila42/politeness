Hi Steve,

I am not sure if you remember meeting me when you were in India several
months back but I am a manager with Global Finance dedicated to the India
team. I received the following resume from a very good, old friend of mine
and thought you might be able to channel it in the right direction. I only
have very positive things to say about Bill; I hope you find that his skills
and backgrounds are of use to Enron and consider talking to him. I am in
India now but am available should you have any questions him.
Thank you for your consideration.
