See the email from Donna Fulton below.  Donna joined Government Affairs a
couple of months ago.  She was with Enron - GPG for 12 years doing gas
regulatory work, so she's an expert in FERC matters but is getting up to
speed on electric matters.  Please feel free to call her in addition to Joe
or me on FERC regulatory matters.
Also, the Cal PX filed at FERC on August 22 its proposal to implement a $350
price cap.  Interventions are due on September 12.  A copy of the filing
(Imaging Format) and FERC's notice are attached.
We should discuss what position we want to take, if any, in response to the
Cal PX's filing.
