Roger - thanks for the review; we want to raise the "wholesale distribution"
concept
Jeff - we will rely on GA to identify our most successful forum (e.g.
workshop, hearing, other); generally we are in support of this proposed
decision as it establishes a CPUC/CEC commitment to address "behind the
meter" competition and the role of the UDC
Phil - we will require technical engineering experts for the workshops and
hearings
