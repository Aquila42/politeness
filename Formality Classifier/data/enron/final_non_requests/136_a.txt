Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms and in house lawyers as well is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF
