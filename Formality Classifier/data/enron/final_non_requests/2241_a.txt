Richard:

It looks to us like Ecogas has a laydown contractual indemnity claim against
GSF Energy LLC, under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of GSF, for any
liability that Ecogas may incur in the Waste Management lawsuit (including
attorneys fees). We could file and serve a cross-complaint against GSF
asserting this claim; alternatively, we could send a demand letter. Either
of these alternatives might set off Montauk. We do not have to do anything
right now in order to preserve the claim.

How should we proceed?
