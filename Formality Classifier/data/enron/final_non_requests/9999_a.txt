Below is the opinion from Rajah & Tann on the arrest of the vessel.

In summary:

1. We need to ascertain if the vessel was under a head timecharterparty as
that would determine the proper party to an action (ie, owners or time
charterers) and the proper vessel to arrest (ie. owner's vessel or time
charterer's vessel).

I have instructed Rajah & Tann to do the necessary searches and
investigations. Russell is also asking the broker for any information which
may be helpful.

I have also instructed Rajah & Tann to put the vessel and any other vessel
ECTS may potentially arrest on shipwatch. The cost of shipwatch is SGD50 to
SGD60 per month per vessel.

2. To arrest the vessel, a writ in rem, a warrant of arrest and a supporting
affidavit of the the facts will have to be prepared.  The writ and warrant
can be obtained within one working day (or over the weekend if necessary and
if the duty registrar is contactable).

We would need to quantify the claim. John, Russell and Sheila  - please let
me have an exact breakdown of the loss incurred.

3. There is practically no possibility of wrongful arrest in this case. Third
party cargo pwners also would not have an action against ECTS as the
arresting party.

4. Security can be posted by the vessel owners to secure the vessel's release.

5. Legal fees for arrest would be in the region of SGD10,000. Disbursements
payable to the Sheriff of the High Court would be between SGD4000 to SGD
SGD7000 (assuming release of the vessel with a week). Other search fees and
shipwatch fees may amount to about SGD2000.
