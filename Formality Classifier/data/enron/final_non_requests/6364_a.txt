Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.
Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was
tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater
precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach.
I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of
background I consulted the London office on their rounding conventions for
Celsuis.

Subject: Global Confirm for Weather

Dear David,

Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's
corrected document.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives,
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.


B.
in Floating amount for
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  "daily temp and climate archive" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?


Thx, Raymond
13 April
