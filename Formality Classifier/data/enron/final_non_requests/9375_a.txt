As Enron continues to innovate and move into new markets, our ability to
attract and retain world-class employees becomes ever more critical to our
success.  We view this challenge to be one of the most important
responsibilities of the Office of the Chairman.

One of the most successful efforts Enron has undertaken to attract talented
employees are the Associate and Analyst Programs.  To more closely align the
needs of our businesses with the recruiting process, effective immediately,
the Associate and Analyst Programs will report directly to the Office of the
Chairman.

Charlene Jackson, Managing Director, will have overall responsibility for the
Programs.  Charlene joined Enron in October 1999 from Salomon Brothers.
Charlene started her career at Salomon as an Associate and left as a Managing
Director.  As an investment banker she covered the energy industry.  She has
also had extensive experience with the Associate and Analyst programs.

Celeste Roberts will continue as director of the Programs and will manage the
daily operations.  Celeste joined Enron in December 1995 from McKinsey & Co.
She became director of the Programs in August 1999 and prior to managing the
Programs was director of the Merchant Services Program.

Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will continue to be actively involved
in the Programs, in addition to her responsibilities for Enron,s Human
Resources and Community Relations functions.

As Enron continues to innovate and move into new markets, the Programs will
change in response.  We will keep you apprised of those changes as they occur.
