Just so you know, I had two things installed on my pc on Friday.  I believe these are both applications we may install elsewhere in the future.  Since then my pcs have not worked, I was given two new pcs and these do not work either.  We have finally got one application working - Outlook, hence the email.  I would suggest that we refrain from rolling out these applications further until the problems have been figured out.

Particular problems I currently have include:
Gas Fundamentals Website - repaired this evening by Mike Guadarama
RiskTrac - complete failure
Credit Risk View - complete failure
Internet Explorer - incredibly slow even when reading from c drive
