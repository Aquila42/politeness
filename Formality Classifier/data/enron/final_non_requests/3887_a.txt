PowerSpring will be unable to attend the OFO Forum scheduled for August 29,
and would like to submit the following item for inclusion in the next
meeting.  Additionally, PowerSpring suggests the OFO Forum meet on a
quarterly basis.
Issue:
During pro-forma tariff discussions on I.99.07.003 Gas Settlement Agreement,
PowerSpring lobbied for customer choice of daily nominating and balancing
for Core Aggregated customers if the customer had installed Automatic Meter
Reading equipment provided by executing the Meter Add-On Tariff.
Additionally, this AMR data would be used for OFO/EFO purposes.  PG&E
contended that the Settlement did not contemplate the use of this data for
these purposes and that the issue should be addressed in the OFO Forum.
PowerSpring requests that this issue be included on the agenda for the next
OFO Forum.
