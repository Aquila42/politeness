Sara,
I  would appreciate your assistance in getting a new Morgan Stanley Account
established ASAP.
Per my understanding this morning, a new company, Enron Investments PLC will
be purchasing shares for the below entity and settlement will occur T+5, next
Monday ( I am not sure, at this time,  if Memorial Day will impact the
settlement date).
Trena and I have a call into CS First Boston to get more specifics regarding
the settlement.
I will inform you as we get more information.
Sheila
