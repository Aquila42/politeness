Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing
proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals.
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business
is the perview of ECC.
Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done
and can help in the pitch.
