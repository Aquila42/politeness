Tana, conceptually no problem with any those entities trading Australian
power assuming they pass the credit check and are properly incorporated. (You
might want to check the full names of Mitsui Global Precious Metals, Itocho
Oil Exploration, IBJ-DL Financial Technology and Nippon Oil Exploration, they
don't appear complete.)  There is a tax treaty between Australia and Japan
hence no further tax checks required.
I note that BHP Japan is listed. BHP is an Australian based corporation.
Whilst there would be no Australian legal impediment I would question why
they would be trading global products through a Japanese subsidary.
