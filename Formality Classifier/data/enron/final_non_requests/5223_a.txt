The 9/7 Commission Agenda seems to have a Wood PD implementing the
Alpert/Davis Bill. I have not seen a copy of the draft.

Item 9 on the agenda  is as follows.
I00-08-002 - Order Instituting Investigation into the functioning of the
wholesale electric market and associated impact on retail rates.
This decision provides an expanded rate stabilization plan for ratepayers of
San Diego Gas & Electric Company, retroactive to June 1, 2000.  This plan
applies to residential, small commercial, and street lighting customers,
including those customers defined as &general acute care hospitals8 and
customers defined as public or private schools for pupils serving grades
K-12, and all accounts on Rate Schedule AL-TOU.  This decision also
establishes a voluntary program for large commercial, agricultural, and
industrial customers.  The accounting procedure for tracking these costs and
revenues is clarified.
