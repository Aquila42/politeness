Hi Lyn:

I have not received an answer for the below request for another Sun
computer.  Did you get it?

We also need to order another regular computer like the others that have
been supplied to the Research Group.  It will be for Tanya Tamarchenko
and her location on the 19th floor is EB 1940.  Tanya has two offices and
does not have a computer in her office on the 19th floor.

Co# 0011 - RC# 100038

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw
