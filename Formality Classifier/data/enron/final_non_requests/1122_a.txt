Vince:

Here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for Anjam actually entails.
It seems to me that Anjam's interest in getting an expat package is mostly
about money.   Based on the UK HR's read of Anjam, they think he will jump.
I have a telephone conference with Anjam at 11:00.  My stance will be 110 is
firm. We will help with the transition via a one time settlement:  flat
rental issues, 500lbs of air shipping for moving furniture, maybe one trip
back to UK a year, but no more.  Re: his concerns of having a place in London
should he want to return, I will say that Vince would be far better at
finding a good spot for you than any HR type, so that part of the "package"
promise is not particularly important.

Any guidelines for me to follow, coach?

Regards,
Grant.
