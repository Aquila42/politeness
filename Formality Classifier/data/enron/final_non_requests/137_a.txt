I'm about done with a redlined version of the 4:16 draft MOU that incorporates the "non-developing party" concept.  I absolutley agree with Bob that we need to communicate our position on (1) non-developing parties and (2) our intent not to sign definitive agreements until the claims are eliminated in writing to everyone before we agree to the MOU.  My redline would be one way to do that, another would be a simple letter explaining our position--i.e., that we will  sign the current MOU but that our understanding of it is that it gives us the flexibility to negotiate for (1) and (2) without being accused of bad faith.
