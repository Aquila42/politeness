Vince/Vasant,

It has been some time since we spoke at the San Antonio conference.
Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and
had to be in bed for a long time.

In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to
another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby
we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm
power sale during the monsoon.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in
Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.

I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will
catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get
some help from your end.

Regards,
Sandeep.
