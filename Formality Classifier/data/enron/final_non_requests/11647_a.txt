You all should have Mary Hain's original analysis.  Bracewell Patterson has
reviewed her analysis and agrees.  It looks to me like we may have some
procedural firepower here as well.  I have been working the last few days
crafting a response to Dave Germaine's letter.  I have been working with
Ellen Banaghan from Tabors Caramanis and Associates -- I think we are close
to boiling our rather technical explanation into a digestable story.
Depending on how Greg's efforts set up meetings with Sladoje and Germaine, we
should have a strategy call soon.
