FYI. This is a presentation/outline that these two ENW guys are putting
together for the group. They will want Legal's appropriate input into aspects
of these materials.
Also, I had copied and circulated to each of you today a State Bar of
Texas-sponsored seminar that is being held later this week (Thurs-Fri) at the
Westchase Hilton on E-Commerce Legal Topics. It's cheap ($250) and appears
quite topical for each of us.
