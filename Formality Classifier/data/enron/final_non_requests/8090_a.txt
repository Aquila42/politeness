Thanks for the quick response.  Agree on #5  just bear in mind it says SCOPE
not implement so it is more of a development of a project.
RE; MG I will keep Tanya apprised of travel plans and give her the option to
be in or out as you two see fit.

Ted,

Item # 5 will require help from IT. My understanding is that currently we are
receiving the
positions aggregated to a daily level.

Also, I talked to Tanya about visiting MG in New York. She is leaving for
vacation on the 26th of July
and can go for a day to NYC prior to this date.

I think that it makes a lot of sense for her to visit MG and to kick
the tires. I asked her to coordinate the trip with you: it makes sense
for both of you to go together. I may join you depending on my availability.

Subject: VAR Priorities

Vince/John,
Below is a brief summary of near-term projects for the enhancement of VAR and
the use of VAR.  As you can tell some are not directly Research issues (some
require the guidance but not direct work product), and are very North
American Wholesale-centric.
Vince,
I think that the only one in which progress requires your input to get kick
started is #5.  All others are in progress with Tanya/Grant involved through
Jeff Shankman's regular meeting.
We would like to get your input as to your priorities (we were thinking Top
5?) and then start knocking some of them out.  It is not meant to be
exhaustive and is focused on fixes as opposed to overhauls.
Thanks
Ted
