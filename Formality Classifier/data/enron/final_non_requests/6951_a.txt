I see what you mean - the GTC's get attached to the confirms when they are
sent out so the confirm desk needs to know which ones to attach if they are
different.

That is correct,  but the possible GTC amendments will be part of the daily
confirmation process.

There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the
internet trading language in the confirm they generate?
