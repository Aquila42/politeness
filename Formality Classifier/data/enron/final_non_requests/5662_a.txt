I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:
1)  Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are
the
final volumes.
