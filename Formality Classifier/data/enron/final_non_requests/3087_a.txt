All:
Ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many P&L's as need the
report, minimizing everyone's cost by sharing a single subscription.
Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC
code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice
of the three cost choices.

Attached note below clarifies Poten's proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription.
Essentially we have three choices:
1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly
"special feature" article)
2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly
"special feature" article, as in three attached examples)
3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for
36 months.

Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No
one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to
others in the corporation.
The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles:
99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean
99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere
99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile
One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.  Some may
be useless, others perhaps quite valuable.  Your call.

Dear Guy,

It was a pleasure speaking to you today.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part
fuel-oil related service:

(1) a one-year subscription to Poten's Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium
Edition), and

(2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest
Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S
FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would
be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price
projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be
accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over
the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.

The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal
installments

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Larry
