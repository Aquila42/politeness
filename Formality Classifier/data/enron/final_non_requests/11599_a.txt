I am not especially surprised that you and Kristin did not get a copy of this
report.  My "assumption" in my message was wishful thinking and not
conviction that the sign-off meeting between you and AA had occurred.

Sally,

Thank you for the copy.  Contrary to your assumption, this is the first
Kristin or I have seen the draft.  I'm sure Kristin will discuss it with you
and her displeasure with AA.

Thanks,
Leslie
