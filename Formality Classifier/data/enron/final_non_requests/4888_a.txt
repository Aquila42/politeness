Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it
is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable
display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community
and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front,
expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and
budgeted next.

Let discuss
