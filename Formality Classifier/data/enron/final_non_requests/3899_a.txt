It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.  After you have
received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of
changes suggested.  I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect
all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.  I will reserve
judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all
responses.
