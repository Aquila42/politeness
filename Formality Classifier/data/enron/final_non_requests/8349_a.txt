I see your point that the put should be higher up on the list.  In my
opinion, this will be the biggest issue with ABB.

Subject: Moore - changes needed to ABB contract

I think the put to ABB should be at $3 MM US and the term 6 months from
agreement execution, as a first cut.  Let's put this higher in the list
(right after the cost items).
The "law" items probably need cleaning up as you suggest Kay - the first
dealt with overall Cdn laws and statutes, the second to specs and standards
and local laws.
The force majeure item (11) should just say that costs for handling through
storage due to FM shall be at the cost of Seller, if Seller is claiming
party.
