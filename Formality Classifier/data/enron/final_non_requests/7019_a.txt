Further to recent correspondence on this subject:
"Killing" EnronOnline deals has always been against policy, for a number of
reasons, including the need to demonstrate to customers that this is a
binding way to do deals and also to provide an auditable process to auditors
who may be sceptical of an online transaction system - i.e. we need to show
that clicking on the screen  results in a deal which results in an invoice
every time.
In the same way that it is rare to conclude a transaction by telephone with a
trader and then attempt to "back out", we must ensure it is a rare event on
EnronOnline. Deals can only be terminated under special circumstances, which
must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the legal department in
consultation with Credit and EnronOnline commercial staff and covered with a
special contract entered into with the Counterparty.
In all other circumstances, "undoing" a deal is at the discretion of the
trader and is most easily accomplished by an OTC transaction which reverses
the volume, price and payment impact, thus addressing most of the concerns
raised below.

Subject: Feedback on EOL killed deals process

I find it difficult to believe we would even be considering the use of OTC
trades to effectively "kill" another deal.  The points Kathryn raise below
are good ones.  How often do deals need to be terminated?  Unless that number
is substantial (and I would hope it is not), why the opposition to executing
a termination agreement with the counterparty and resolving the problem in
the cleanest manner?
