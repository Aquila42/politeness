I have let Lexi know that I have a conflict with this meeting time -- I will
be doing a business review meeting with Jeff Skilling on global risk
management operations at 10:00 on September 7th.  I just wanted you to know
that I continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at OU.  I have asked
Lexi to update me on the meeting.  --Sally
