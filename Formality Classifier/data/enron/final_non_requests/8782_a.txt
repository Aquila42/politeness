On point #6, our tax dept. is recommending the following:
- delete 3(a)(ii) in its entirety
- in 3(a)(i), replace the reference to form 1001 with a reference to Form
W-8-BEN

Carol,

I spoke to our in house counsel about the arbitration clause and they are
willing to leave it in.
So, to sum up here are our responses your original eMail:

1.  Canadian Securities Rep:  Please have your Canadian counsel review our
language which our outside Canadian counsel prepared.
2.  Ok.
3.  We're ok with this now.
4.  We're ok to leave this in.
5.  Ok.
6.  Please see my comments below.

Thanks,

Sandy Morrison
