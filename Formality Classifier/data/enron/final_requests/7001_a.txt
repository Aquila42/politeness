Ben, please find attached below the preliminary O&M cost estimate for O&M
services to mobilize and operate the 4 x LM6000 peaking facility to be
situated at an existing UAE cogen plant in Lowell, Mass.   It assumes some
allocated costs for common facilities, operating/admin expenses and staff at
the UAE plant to be added to the incremental expenses that are estimated to
occur as a result of the plant addition. Please review it and consider its
accuracy to be +/- 25%. Call if you have any questions.
