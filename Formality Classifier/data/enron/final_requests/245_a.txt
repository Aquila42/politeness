I talked with Greg before we okayed the memo regarding the Logistics trip to South Beach.  I did this over the phone, and told him that I would get him a copy of the memo so that he could see the list of pipelines and the attendees at the two events.  He would like to go!  Hope that this will work.  What else do we need to do to make this happen for Greg?

Bob - are you going to attend one or both of the trips?  With Tyler being so little it hasn't worked for me during the past few years, but this year I could probably go.  Let me know when you are going and I'll see if I can to at the same time.
