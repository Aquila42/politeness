Hello my Esteemed Doctors,
I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers.
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our
master swap agreement.
In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the
more intermediate "Omnibus" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.
