Who is working on assignment of CES deals in the Statoil portfolio to J.
Aron???  We have succesfully moved all the other financial deals and have
obtained collateral from J. Aron.  However, $10MM of exposure remains behind
in the CES/Statoil portfolio.  Would this not have been included in the
assignment? Please advise status.
