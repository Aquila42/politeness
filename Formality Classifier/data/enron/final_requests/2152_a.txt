Maria Salazar has sent me some more maps that show more details of individual
pipelines.   I like the details and formatting of the map that Kevin Hyatt
sent out...so I think that would be good to use for the main map (although
Maria pointed out that some of the pipeline details have not been updated).
The maps that are attached below could be used for the "drill down" from the
main map to the detailed maps (the customer would point and click on the
company they want and then get to a more specific map with greater detail on
the individual pipe).  What do you think?  What details do we want to show
for the drill down maps?
