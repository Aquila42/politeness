If you would like to contribute to the fund for Bob, please have your
donation to me before 4:30 p.m. today.  We have decided to donate the money
in memory of his Grandmother to the nursing home she had lived in for the
past 3 years.  I will also be filling out the form for Enron's Gift Matching
Program.  A small portion of the money will be for a plaque for Bob that will
be engraved with language regarding our donation.    Bob does not know about
this!  I will get the plaque over the weekend and we can present it to Bob
sometime next week.
