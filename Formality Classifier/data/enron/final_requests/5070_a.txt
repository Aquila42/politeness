To make the Senior Prom a huge success, I need 40-50 volunteers to join me at
Ripley House.  Volunteer activities include helping with the Bingo game,
serving brunch, being a dance partner and mingling with the seniors.

Transportation to Ripley House will be provided.  We,ll plan to leave the
Enron building around 7:30am and return around 12:30/12:45pm.  The shuttle
will also run between Ripley House and the Enron building around 10am.
