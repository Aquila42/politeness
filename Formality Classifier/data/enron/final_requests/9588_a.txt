Edmund:

As you requested, attached please find the first draft of the revised Legal
and Privacy statement.  David Gilberg with Sullivan & Cromwell has made at
first pass at revisions.  I intend to review and revise as necessary and will
pass on any revisions to you.  I look forward to any comments you may have.
By separate e-mail, I am also forwarding to you a copy of a memo that David
has prepared outlining various issues impacting Phase II content.

Leslie
