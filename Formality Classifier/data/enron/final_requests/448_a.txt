Valerie:  Are children of UBS Warburg Energy employees eligible for this scholarship program?  I know that we are not one of the exceptions listed below, but I wanted to make sure that this list is up-to-date with the addition of UBS Warburg Energy.   If indeed we are eligible, please sent me an application.  Our oldest daughter is a senior in high school and will be going to college in the fall.  Thanks.
