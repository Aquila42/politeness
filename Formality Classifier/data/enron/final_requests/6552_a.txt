Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii
