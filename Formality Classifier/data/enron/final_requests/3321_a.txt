I have rolled # 143559 through July 2000 to cover the purchase from
Republic.  We sell this gas to Duke Energy Field Services (#143558 for Jan -
Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal
has been suspeneded, so I created # 316727 under the counterparty of Duke
Energy Field Services Marketing, LLC.

Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke
counterparty to this deal.

If you have any questions, let me know.
