Enclosed is a back-line of the Energy Group's Position Paper reflecting
comments that we have received.  We would like to send this to the CFTC and
Capitol Hill by 4:00 p.m. today.  Please let me know if you have any
additional comments.

We are set for meetings with House and Senate Staff and CFTC Chairman Rainer
on Wednesday, April 12.  Mark Taylor (Enron), Donna Lance (Koch) and Michael
Goldstein (Sempra) have agreed to attend.
