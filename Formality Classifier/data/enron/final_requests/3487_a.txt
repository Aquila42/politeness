I'm not sure I understand it.  I wonder if they mean payment in full has been
made as of the time of the assignment.
I'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so I can get to this, hopefully
this afternoon.

The last sentence of this clause was not included in my last draft.   After
being on vacation for four days, I can't remember why I did or didn't do
what.   Please let me know if you agree that this last sentence should be
added and if there are any other changes needed.
Thanks.
