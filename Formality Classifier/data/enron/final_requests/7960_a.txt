Chris,
Six month 15MW transaction with Atlantic Richfield is fine.

Tanya:

I showed them a price and it looks like they will not be transacting today.
The heat is off temporarily, but I would like to make sure we are OK with
credit as they very well could be transacting soon.  Can we do this
transaction?  Please note that the volume is 15 MW and not 50 as indicated in
the confirm.

Thanks

Chris

Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade
TODAY.  We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the
transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a
parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara
