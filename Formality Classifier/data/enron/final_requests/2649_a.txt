Mark Taylor, the attorney I work for, has agreed to the changes you made, so
if you would like to process the agreement on your side and fax the signed
copy to me I will have it executed by an authorized officer here.  Thanks for
your prompt review and have a nice Memorial Day holiday!

Subject: RE: Altra Confidentiality Agreement

Tana,
Attached is a redline with a few changes to the letter.  These should all be
consistent with the substance you have.
Let me know if you or Mark wish to discuss.
