I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for
bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last
week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still
in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC.

Mark,
Attached is a copy of the OTC GTC which the Bandwidth group wishes to use for
Bandwidth trading on EnronOnline, launching May 1.
Could you please let me know which of your guys will be looking after
reviewing/amending this for EnronOnline?
Thanks,
Dave
