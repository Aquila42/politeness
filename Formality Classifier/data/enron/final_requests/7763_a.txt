The email that you sent to me below does not pertain to to the referenced
entity.  Did you send me this email in error?  In order to open to the
brokerage account for Rafael Rangel, we need corporate resolutions and an
authorized traders list for the referenced entity.    On June 1, 2200, I
emailed our form of corp. resolutions and authorized traders list to you and
Rafael.  I will send the email to you again.   Please advise me of when I
should expect to receive these documents so that we can open the acccount.
Please call me if you have any questions.
