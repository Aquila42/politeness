Janice:

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you - Elizabeth is now working in the
power trading area and Sara has been out of town.

I agree with you that the letter seems harmless enough and I wouldn't blame
the commercial folks for being upset if it looks like GS is trying to do and
end-around on the process.  Yes - let's send it and get an opportunity to
participate in offering the products.

Subject: Re: Resuming Financial Risk Management Opportunity in Guam

I've been asked by the EI team whether they can send this letter (all the way
at the bottom of these notes) to the client this week.  In order to get this
out by Friday morning in Guam, it has to be done on Thursday close of
business Houston time.   Is there any chance that we could accomplish this?
Please advise.
