Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?  Currently on deal 131478
(ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been
zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I
need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.  But, I want to make sure
that is what we need to do.

Could you please setup a spot deal for October under ICC Energy Corp.  I
would just copy the TXU deal below.  I believe the pricing is the same.
