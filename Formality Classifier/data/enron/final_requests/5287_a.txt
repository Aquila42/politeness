Based on the attached, NBP is extremely cheap!  While the level of required
premium over the current market price to buy back the shares is difficult to
determine, I wonder why we wouldn't take a hard look at buying Duke's units
(at no premium).  I see basically two paths:  First, a strategic investment
made in contemplation of buying the remainder of the NBP units back
(presumably at a premium over current prices)  and then contributing the NBP
investment into the new regulated entity structure (at higher values).
Second, at these prices the investment in NBP units compares favorably to
other acquisitions GPG is looking at, e.g. East Tennessee.  Even if the
contribution to the new entity doesn't occur, GPG could hold the Duke units
for an indefinite time period, report reasonably good incremental earnings
and cash flow and sell them back to the public at an opportunistic level.
What do you think?
