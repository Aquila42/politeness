Dale,
To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
that Sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to
55,000
with a sign-on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.
I shall be in Australia next week. If you need
any additional intervention from us, please, call Stinson.

Dale,
I was very impressed with Sharad and I think that we should consider paying
offering him
o50,000. I am not sure about guaranteed bonus. What do you think?
