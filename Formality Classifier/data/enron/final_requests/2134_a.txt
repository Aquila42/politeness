Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e.,
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable
Topock space is part of that package.

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.
