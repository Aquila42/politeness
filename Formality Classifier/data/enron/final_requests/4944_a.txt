Thanks for the help Dan.  I didn't know if Jeff was in today or not.  I will
forward Jeff's version to you for reference purposes.   I think the best
course of action is to mark up their form with the changes we would need and
add whatever you think is necessary.  Then we'll just e-mail it back to them
for comments.  It seems to me they are trying to drag their feet, so if we
can push them a little that would be great.

George,
I am not sure what language Jeff had proposed; however, I would note that 5
years from disclosure is too long.  I would suggest that the period be
shortened 3 years from the date of  the agreement or 2 years from
disclosure.  The choice of law as New Jersey is also a problem, I would
prefer Texas or New York.  Also, the correct name for ENA is Enron North
America Corp.  Please let me know how you want to respond to their draft of
the document.

Dan,
Can you compare this CA sent to us by PSE&G to the standard one Jeff had sent
them?

Thanks,
George
