Hi, Linda.   I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too.  I was out on
vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.  I hope
that ELM has received the response by now.  Let me know if I need to do
anything else.  Michelle

Hi Michelle. Unfortunately, this issue with Eddie Lynn Morgan is still alive.
I talked with Kim a few weeks ago and she mentioned that she sent her
write-up to you for your review - before sending it to Eddie Lynn. Do you
have a status update on when it will be ready to go to Eddie Lynn?

Thanks Michelle!
