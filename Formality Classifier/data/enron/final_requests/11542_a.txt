Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).  I haven't heard any
details.  It was originally planned to close after X-mas but maybe it will
happen in the next few days.  FYI - I'll be out of the office after X-mas
until next year.  SS

Is this the most recent copy of the Merrill Lynch confirmation?
