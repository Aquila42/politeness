Souad,
We can use the Deemed ISDA format I already sent you.  And the guarantees
(when we get them) should work for allfinancial transactions.

Tana,
Another deal was executed on 8/25/00 with  Gas Natural Mexico (#NW9602).  Can
we have this deal roll up under the pending Deemed ISDA and Gty that their
parent was to issue ENA (Use Credit Previously Provided)?
Give me a call at x6-6002 if you have any questions.
Thanks,
