Subject: Vince Kaminski's Oct. 11 Presentation -- "Enron Day at the Energy
Finance Program"

Vince -

Christy Young is the UT MBA recruiter. She is taking a couple of weeks off to
get married and will return on July 19th as Christy Meador.  In her absence,
I wanted to make sure we coordianted our efforts with you.

Below are a few key UT recruiting dates. Ideally, we would like for your
presentation to occur a week or so before our interview list is due to the
Career Services Office. This will allow for additional candidates to submit
their resumes for our review before we turn in the interview list.

Wed., Sept. 13 - Corporate Presentation & Reception - Alumni Center
Fri., Sept. 22 - Eye's of Texas Career Fair - Campus
Thurs., Sept. 28 - Enron Interview List due to Career Services Office
Wed., Oct. 11 - Pre-interview Reception - selected candidates only
Thurs., Oct. 12 - First Round Interviews
Fri., Oct. 13 - Second Round Interviews
Sat., Oct. 28 - Super Saturday for UT Candidates

Please let me know what works best with your schedule. Note that October 11
is the same date as our pre-interview reception.

We look forward to working with you on this.

Thanks,
Cindy Justice
