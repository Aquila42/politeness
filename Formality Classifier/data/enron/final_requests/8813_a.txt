Travis:
My understanding is that the Password Application/ETA has been vetted in
Singapore (Edmund Cooper in London or Matt Lee could re-confirm this), but I
do not know about South Africa.

Subject: Re: EOL -- European counterparties

Justin:
Thank you for your message.  Let me know if there is anything I should be
doing to help you out from this side.
I have attached the list of countries in which the Pulp and Paper group
expect to have clients that will be active traders on Clickpaper.com.  I
believe that EOL has ETAs and Password Applications prepared for these
jurisdictions, but I'm not sure where we stand on Singapore, South Africa or
Ireland.  Justin, you probably know where we are with Ireland, -- Alan or
Mark -- any idea on where we may stand in South Africa or Singapore?
Justin, I would assume that the form of ETA that EOL currently uses for a
particular jurisdiction could be revised to reflect  Clickpaper as the
counterparty, but I noticed that EOL's form of ETA is with a UK entity.
Should Clickpaper adopt the same structure for trading in Europe?
