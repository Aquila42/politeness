I know where I stand!....
Yes, just go ahead and ignore all those emails, and lets start over, ok....

1) What is the status of CNG Producing Company  - Deal #77755?  The contract
was called Trag 110,
and I see that in the service list on CNG Transmission, but it needs to be
pathed starting 07/99 through current.
Also, the rates are showing up as:
Transportation       $.19910     but should be $.06
ACA                           $.00220     Should not be paying ACA
Compression          $.00000    Should be $.22

2)   What is the status of CNG Field Services - Deal #125711 (Marco Pipeline)
- Coronado Pipeline  Enterprises?

I have more, but do you think that we could get these 2  taken care of
today?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

I bet you think I have been ignoring you, right?  Does this mean I don't have
to read all those emails you sent me?

Subject: Rates Corrections

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here!

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made
effective 12/1999 production forward.

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,
Carrie
