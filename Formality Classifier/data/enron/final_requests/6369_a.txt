Dear David,
I am a little surprised about Westpac's email since we have not seen an
official final version of the Schedule yet.
Last night I sent Westpac a mark-up of a Schedule they sent on 4.5.00. A few
typos needed to be fixed (I will fax the Schedule which shows my comments
dated 4.10.00). If they correct those - then the Schedule should in a final
form. Re: the MAC - Rod Nelson from Credit agreed that it need not be
included (if you think about it - the MAC would have benefited them more than
us anyway).
Attached please find the Enron Corp. Guarantee was heavily negotiated and
finally agreed with Westpac (and Clement, of course).
Please come back to me directly if you have any questions or if Westpac tries
to deviate from the agreed ENA Schedule.
Kind regards,
