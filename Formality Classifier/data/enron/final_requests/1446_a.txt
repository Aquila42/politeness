Tana,

I have talked with everyone involved, Anthony Campos, Mark Thorne, etc., and
everyone is in agreement that original guarantees should now come to credit.
If you could please, just make sure that they come to my attention so that
they can be briefed and entered into our Credit Agg System.  If you have any
questions please give me a call.

Thanks
