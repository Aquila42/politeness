Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for
the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word "volumetric" as
that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly
to have "volumetric" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate
schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary
in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  "on a daily basis
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized".
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more
issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.
