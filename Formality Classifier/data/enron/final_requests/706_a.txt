Marc,

I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of
L/C we would require.  Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we
can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.  Let me know
if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away -
shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.

Mark,

FYI: Ram Srivastav is the President of DPC. Can we send DPC the format of the
Stdby L/C to advance the credit risk portion? We're not committing to
actually putting a derivative in place, just familiarizing them with the
necessary tools. The legal risk aspect will be covered when we get their
outside counsel opinion sent to us. Please let me know. While I feel strongly
that we need to cover all of ECT's bases, especially when dealing with the
Indians, I don't want to appear to hold up the process. Let me know what you
think.

Marc
