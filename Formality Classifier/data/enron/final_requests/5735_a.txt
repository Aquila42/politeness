I've spoken with Bryan - your understanding is correct - there will initially
be circa 250 products total spread across the product types (which are
defined by the country of incorporation of the reference credit).
He is hoping to grow this quickly.

Memo

Bryan

Mark told me that in the meeting (legal trading weekly conference call, Paul
spoke of a different 250 products per country?  Is this right?  This has some
serious implications.  Could you let us know as this hasn't come up before I
had assumed your 250 products were the same whatever the country.

Regards

Memo

Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for
completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on
EnronOnline.
There are two remaining issues which require further thought:-

1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline.
For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates
will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection the
initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection
250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do
have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneouse
changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much
better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage
that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we
will do when FX joins the system.

2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credit
pricing from a due diligence perspective.

Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline group at the end of this week and Mark
Dilworth will be our main point of contact in Dave's absence.  Any questions
please do not hesitate to call me (713 853 3488).

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Memo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO
As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely
change the analysis below.)
Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summary
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.
A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000
Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US
B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be
delayed
Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)
C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)
The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks
of a general nature:
(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their
constitutional documents if they wish to trade).
The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.
(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that
entity for breach of confidence.
D.  Country Specific Issues
(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.
(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.
(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic
behind its trading this product type.
(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However,
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.
(v)  US (New York Law)
(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under
the US Commodities Exchange Act.
(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should
not impede the business.
(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.
