Attached is the draft no-action letter for EnronOnline that Mark Haedicke
asked us to prepare.  Please note that we have made a number of factual
assumptions about third party business that should be carefully reviewed by
the EOL team.  Please let us know where we should go from here.  We should
look to get this to the CFTC in draft as soon as possible.
