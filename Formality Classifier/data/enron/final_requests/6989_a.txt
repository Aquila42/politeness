Sarah --

Can you please set up a call to discuss the following?

1. EPSA / FERC Meeting.

The Aug 24 FERC meeting and Enron's participation?  I hope that you, Mary
Hain and Jeff Dasovich will be able to attend.  This is pretty important and
we need to make sure that we have the issues outlined well.

2. CA meeting with Scott Miller.

Also, can we meet with Scott Miller while he is in California?  Do we need
get on his schedule?  Messages we want delivered?  Can we find out who he is
meeting with?

3. CA ISO Information.

Finally, we need more information from the CA ISO to handle the upcoming AG
investigation.  Is Scott Miller getting information from the CA ISO that we
can't get?  Mary, what information is public and what is confidential.  I was
wondering if we needed to ask FERC to order more information into the public
domain to undertake the investigation.  The AG will be getting the
information, so why not get it first?  Also, why not leverage this
investigation into asking for more information from the CA ISO (including the
list Jeff D. put together earlier)?
