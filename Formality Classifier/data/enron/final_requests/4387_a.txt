Raymond,
Thank you for your note.  It would be great if you could be ready to roll-out
Korean Weather in the near future.   It would be tough to sell Weather
Derivatives in Korea, but the early move can be positive for us especially
because K-Weather, a local weather forecasting company, is also studying
Weather Derivatives for potential launch.  Regarding the questions you asked,
please find below my answers in blue.  Thanks.

Subject: Comments & questions re: EOL Korea

To Jae- Moo,
1. Impressive P'point presentation indeed.

2. Friday Sep 1 - 800am TYO time is good for Australia, I will be attending
is there anything that i need to arrange at our end ??

3. After the successful roll-out of W for Japan & Oz thus qtr,
as discussed - we are ready to roll-out Korean W say in Mid October ???
Your email & presenatation thus arrived at a very good time.

4. Just some questions -
You may answer in the conference call or by email -- your choice

(a) why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review
when there is no regulation of eg LPG , or plastics swaps & fwds  ?  (pg 11
of presentation)

We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSC's (Financial
Supervisory Commission) review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelty
in Korea although, according to the Kim & Chang report, there are currently
no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative
transactions through the internet or otherwise.  When we talked to FSC a
couple of months ago, they confirmed that there is no law or regulation
restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea.  FSC did not indicate any intention
to review Weather Derivatives for regulation, either.   In addition,
according to the Kim & Chang report, Weather Derivatives would not be
considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance
regulations.  Kim & Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not
be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks
relating to weather.

(b) How necessary are the meetings with ( pg 5 of presentation)
".. Bank of Korea (BOK)/ Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) for
classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives.." ?
Is this meeting to meet
"...except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations (FETR) in case of
foreign currency trades
Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivatives
under FETR needs to be resolved..."(pg 15 of presentation)

Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty ? If so , if
Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea,
there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea !
Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all .

According to the Kim & Chang report,   FETR is the only regulation that
regulates OTC derivative transactions, and FETR is applicable only when FX is
involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean resident
and a non-resident.  Thus, as far as we understand based on the Kim & Chang
report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers, if a transaction
(Weather derivative or other commodity derivative) is between residents in
Korea (e.g., a Korean customer and Enron Korea) in Korean currency (Won),
neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable.  No report or approval
would be required.

(c)
pg 18 of presentation
'...All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and
emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea..."
Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently?
Will not Weather fall under same category ?

There is no classification or definition of bandwidth, emission or weather
derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products
or concepts.  Please refer to my previous e-mail to Matt for definitions of
derivative transactions (commodity and financial).

"...Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea for
each trade .."
Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency ?

The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied
for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and non-resident in
Korea.


5. pg 28 of presentation
Note that Dr Christian Werner - Sydney office will be the person for
"Data system   For weather derivative products, arrange with a weather
forecasting company for the weather data feed - timing depends on the
location"

We will provide relevant information for Christian.

We will be able to assist with (if reqd, see points 4b & c above)  Thanks. It
would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR.
"...  For weather derivatives, arrange presentation meetings with BOK/MOFE
for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives
_ May require longer time for their decision making
Korea Office, Mike Dahlke, EOL Weather specialist (?)"


Best wishes
Raymond

Subject: Re: EOL Korea

Jae-Moo
On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:
1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your and
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).
2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim &
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on which
a report may be rejected.
3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval,
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of the
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval is
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals since
reporting and approval may take several weeks.
4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorization
that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign party
to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds.

Matt

Subject: EOL Korea

As many of you are aware, over the past few months we have been investigating
whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in
Korea from a market, regulatory and legal perspective.  The primary interest
has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in
Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new
products (e.g., Seoul weather).

This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within the
APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point,
however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To
facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to
date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at the
attached document.

We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at
6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the
attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me
know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict,
an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Jae-Moo
