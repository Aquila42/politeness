Dear Mr. Brannvoll,

I just spoke with our Legal contact and he advised me that your Enron North
America ISDA will cover any
derivative product trading conducted with ENA. The long description for the
product will identify which
entity you are transacting with.  At which time the European office sponsors
a product, the trade would be
considered with a new counterparty and it would be necessary to obtain an
ISDA with this entity.  The ENA
ISDA would then be re-excecuted using the new counterparty name.

One contact I have made during the course of our discussion is Mr. Mark
Taylor in our Legal Department.  He has
offered his name as a contact available for calls on this matter.  His number
is 713-853-1459.

I hope that this answers your question.  Please feel free to contact myself
or Mark in any other
questions you may have.

Regards,

Subject: RE: Stora Enso Financial Services S.A.: Request for Information

Dear Camille
Thank You very much for your fast answer, I appreciate this a lot.
I have today spoken with Mr. Martin Holmes in your London office, and I have
now ( I hope) understood, that by dealing with Clickpaper.Com, I eventually
will have a trade with Enron North America, and as StoraEnso Financial
services is having a ISDA documentation in place these trades will then be
covered through this ISDA.

Please let me know if this is wrong.....................

Regards
Frank O. Brannvoll
