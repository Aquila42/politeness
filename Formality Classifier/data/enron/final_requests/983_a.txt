Joe,
The hounding can soon stop from Credit.  I sent a copy of the assignment
notification to Bridgette Anderson in Financial Global Contracts this
afternoon, she is going to have legal approve it and then she can have the
contracts assigned.  Can you follow up with her so the deals can be moved
over.

Russell/John,

I can't remember which of you was requesting the change for Phoenix deals to
be moved to Dominion Field Svcs, but here's the latest.  Neither Susan Bailey
or Tana Jones knows of an Assignment or name change, so if you have any
back-up info on these, let me know.  Until we get notified by someone in
Legal, we're not able to move these deals over.  Let me know if you have
anything.

Thanks,
Joe
