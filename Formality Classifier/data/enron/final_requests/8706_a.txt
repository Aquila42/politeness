Message to EDS regarding insourcing

Enron views technology as a strategic focus, and technology staff as
strategic resources.

We want to incent these strategic resources to minimize the risk of them
leaving the organization and Enron,s compensation plans allow us to mitigate
that risk (Enron has 5% attrition, technology industry 20%).  We also believe
that many of these people want to be part of the Enron organization.

This doesn,t mean we don,t want to do business with EDS, but we do want to
change the way we do business with EDS, which will position EDS to sell
services that truly are &value add8 and not time and material.

EDS will continue to have a role at Enron:  GPG infrastructure, Azurix,
Elektro and possibly EES (work with ATKearney).

And Enron, as a highly visible, &well-decorated8 company*, will continue to
be a positive reference for EDS and it,s potential customers, including
discussions of how we have outsourced and then insourced different technology
functions and continue to maintain a positive relationship.
