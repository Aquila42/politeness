I do not seem to have received the documentation referred to in my e-mail
below.  I should be grateful if you would e-mail the execution versions both
to me and Michael Khajeh-Noori so that we can mirror the documentation for
the purposes of negotiating a new ISDA with Kellogg's UK entity.
Alternatively, if it is not possible to e-mail them, please fax them to me (+
44 20 7783 8171).
If you  have any questions, please let me know.
In the meantime, many thanks for your help.
Regards
