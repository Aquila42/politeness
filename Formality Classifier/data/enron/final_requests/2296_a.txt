Subject: EnronOnline in Argentina

Patrick,

I am pleased to hear that Argentina wants to be live with EnronOnline
September 1. We will support your effort to make it a success. However, I
have a few concerns:

Whatever the local differences, the commercial effort will be very similar to
that in Brazil. Therefore, I recommend you involve the relevant commercial
people there, so we can replicate experiences and lessons learned. I agree
and  I have proposed whoever the applicable Sao Paulo resources are that will
have responsibility for EOL should be part of the process either via our
weekly conference calls or physically present in Argentina during strategic
periods of implementation. The relevant Sao Paulo functions should decide how
important this is to them and allocate time and resources accordingly.
Can you please specify your resource requirements for IT support for both
implementation and operation. I do not believe we are adequately staffed and
we can not afford to have any So Paulo IT resources sucked into this without
proper planning. We have always tried not to suck on Sao Paulo unless
absolutely necessary. We will continue to operate in this manner. We have
kept the appropriate people aware of our status and situation on a weekly
basis and I believe we have all the necessary resources up and running now. I
will have a better feel after my meetings this week.
The bandwidth installed from BA to Houston is not sufficient to support the
operation of front and back office. Lead time for upgrades is 90 days. We
have been aware of this need for a period of time. We will need a solution to
the time schedule you are proposing. Please assist in this effort and let me
know what our options are.

In the future, I will appreciate to be informed and consulted on any
activities in our region involving Enron Net Works.
You have been involved in our meetings over the past few months although
Patrick has indicated we missed you in the scheduling  of the latest
implementation meeting . We will cc everyone to avoid not fully communicating
in the future. I will also forward the full implementation schedule and
assignments to the above cc list.

If you have any additional concerns please contact me directly.

MFG


Thanks, Steve
