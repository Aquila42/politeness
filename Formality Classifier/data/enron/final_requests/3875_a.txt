The Global team has not yet received current OnLine GTC's for the US or
Canada.  I will call you.

Karen,

Thank you for your email. I'm surprised you are having difficulty obtaining
current information from me, as your email attached below postdated both my
conversation with Philippe Travis in which he explained that GCD would like
copies of the contracts, and the email sent to him which contained GTC's.

After speaking with Philippe, I asked Edmund Cooper, who works with Justin
Boyd in our legal dept and who had supplied the previous email containing
GTC's, to continue to forward EnronOnline copies as required. To my
knowledge, this has been done.

If you are still having difficulties obtaining copies, please let me know. I
can be contacted in Houston at 31861 and will be arriving there Thursday
afternoon.

Thanks,

Dave

Mark Taylor (EOL counsel) requested that I coordinate directly with you
because you are the point person gathering a complete set of OnLine GTC's.
Please let me know when I can expect current information regarding the US and
Canadian OnLine GTC's.

Because we could not obtain current information from you, Philippe (our
Global Contracts database contact in London)  has, at my request, gathered
information regarding the European OnLine GTC's from his contacts in
London.   I am not aware of who "Justin" is.  Can you provide me with a last
name?

We still need the information regarding US and Canadian OnLine GTC's.

Thank you,
Karen
