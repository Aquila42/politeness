Steve:

Been wanting to drop you a line just to say hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around, and you can count on that.  If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Best,
Jeff
