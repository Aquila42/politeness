Subject: Re: Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corp. - 9/99 production - price

Eric,

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this
month?

Thank you,
Melissa
