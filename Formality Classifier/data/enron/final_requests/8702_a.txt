Subject: Interview Request

Hi guys.  My friend, Polly Traylor, is an editor at the Industry Standard in
San Francisco.  One of her colleagues -- Michelle Rafter --  sent me the
email below requesting an interview for an Enron story she is working on.  I
have not spoken with this writer and am forwarding it to you for follow up.

Hope all is well.  Call me if you have any questions.
