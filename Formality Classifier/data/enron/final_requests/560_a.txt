In connection with the preparation of confidentiality agreements, the agreements should be signed by either Rick Buy or Bill Bradford as follows:

ENRON CORP.

By:__________________________
Richard B. Buy
Executive Vice President and
Chief Risk Officer


OR


ENRON CORP.

By:__________________________
William S. Bradford
Vice President of Risk Assessment
and Control Group, a division of
Enron Corp.

If you know who will be signing the Confidentiality Agreement, you should complete the "name" and "title" information before sending it to Legal for initialling.  If you are not sure who will sign, then you will need to either type or print the information as above once Rick or Bill has signed the agreement.

Thanks for your assistance and, if you have any questions, please contact Legal.
