I'm following up with Cindy Skinner of ECT HR to try and get this resolved.
Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.

Mark,

I really have no idea what this is all about, but it seems to be spiralling a
bit out of control.  I'm in NYC today, but could you call Ms Arteaga and sort
this out?  Let me know if I need to do anything.

Thanks,
Randy
