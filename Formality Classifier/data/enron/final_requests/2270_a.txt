Ken,  This looks fine..as long as we are certain that only notification is
required to effectuate this change.  Send a copy of each letter to Bob
Walker.

Shonnie,

I plan to put this on Enron letterhead and put my name and number on it.
Could you please review it and let me know if you have any comments?

Thanks
Ken
