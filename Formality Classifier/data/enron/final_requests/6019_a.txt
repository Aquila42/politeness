FYI....
This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.
Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)
I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed.
Will keep you posted.
Thanks,
dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)

Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change."

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM
Market East - but not from
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity.
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items
were locked down for a reason.
If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
UNIFY.
