I must have neglected to copy you on the disapproval rationale for Duke
Energy Trading & Marketing, LLC.  This entity does not prepare (for the
public anyway) independent financial statements.  S&P has assigned its rating
based on affiliation with and implied support and capitalization from Duke
Energy, Inc.  Financial statements have been a requirement for all reference
cps.
I would think that pricing such a credit would be extremely difficult, since
this would essentially require estimating the probability that Duke Energy
would honor this entity's obligations in the event of financial distress.  In
addition, the probability that such support would be needed is completely
unknown, since no financials are available for Duke Energy Trading &
Marketing.

Mark & Rod:

If  I read correctly the earlier note from Rod, there are questions about
Duke Energy Trading & Marketing as a reference entity -- there has been no
decision of disapproval.

I f you have decided not to approve them, then please inform me directly.
And please tell me why.

In general, what drives the approval decisions?  This is important to know to
make the front end of transactions more intelligent about these affairs, and
to forestall any antagonism within the firm.

Also, bear in mind this is an off-line reference entity

Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy
Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.  I don't think it makes sense to
review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.  Please let
me know if the situation changes.

There are a variety of CAs with U.S. Duke Energy entities.
Mary J. Heinitz has provided me with a list of these which I'll forward to
Mark for his consideration under the cover of a separate email.
