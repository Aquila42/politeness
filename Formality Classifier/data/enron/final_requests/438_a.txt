Arthur,

I am still working for "&", formerly known as Enron Corp.  I figured that since the musician Prince no longer used the symbol that we might as well.  I have been working on managing and closing down all of the markets that we worked so hard to get up and running.

I was watching the news the other day, specifically coverage of the Town Hall meeting and I saw you.  I think the whole Enron situation is terrible and being a long-term Enron employee (both myself and my wife) it has been very difficult.  I am so disapointed in the leaders that Enron choose and can hardly stand to listen to any of them, especially Jeff Skilling.

What have you been doing with yourself?  Do you have any idea of what you are going to do?  Did you find the Town Hall meeting of any benefit?  What did you think of Stephen Cooper?

My wife has become an employee of UBS Warburg; I am just hanging on here as long as I can and currently have no idea of what will come after Enron.

I have spent quite a bit of time thinking of all good people that I have been associated with at Enronhave worked at Enron and you certainly are one of tehtmhave been thinking of all of the peopTake care and if you get a chance to respond I would love hearing from you.
