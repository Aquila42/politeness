Hello everyone:

Just when you get used to something it changes!

As you may have heard, Enron is implementing a new time entry system as part
of the July 1 SAP implementation.  Time entry for the June 16th- 30th period
must be entered into SAP by 3:00 pm CST on June 30th.  As your Timekeeper, I
will assist with this process and ensure that we meet this very important
deadline.

I will continue to do the time sheets for the 19th floor and for Osman and
Samer.

Sam Smith and/or Kevin Moore will be responsible for the timesheets for the
weather group on the 32nd Floor.

Time can be entered in SAP in two ways:
you can enter your time yourself using the new eHRonline feature; or,
timekeepers can enter time on your behalf.

If you are unsure as to which approach you should use, please call me.
Please remember that all time for this period must be submitted before 3:00
pm CST, on June 30th.

For those of you using eHRonline:
First of all, congratulations on taking this next step toward Enron,s vision
of empowering the employee.  By using the new eHRonline feature, you are
helping Enron to realize the value in this SAP implementation.  Hopefully,
you too, will receive value from having instant access to your personal
information.

The new eHRonline functionality is:
easy to use
accessible through the Enron intranet at eHRonline.enron.com

Using this feature, you can not only enter your own time, but also maintain:
your profile information (skills, education, and experience)
home address
phone numbers
W-4 changes
emergency contact information

Additionally, you will be able to view your individual pay advice and benefit
elections.

You will receive your personal ID and password via e-mail from SAP_Security
by June 22nd.  Because of the confidentiality of the information accessible
using eHRonline, it is important that you keep your ID and password
confidential.  If you do not receive your information by the end of the day
on June 22nd, please call the COE at (713) 345-4SAP to obtain your ID and
password.

The Apollo & Beyond team has teamed with EBS to deliver training on how to
enter time using eHRonline via EBS, new product EnronCast.  This tool is
available to you on your desktop.  You can access EnronCast at
www.enroncast.com and follow the instructions.

For those of you who need me to enter your time:
Attached is a manual time entry form that I must have completed and returned
by June 28th.  Please estimate the last two days of the period as accurately
as possible.  If necessary, I can make corrections on the next time entry
period.  If you do not want to use this form, I will have hard copies at my
desk and will be glad to help you fill them
out.  I know this is creating more work for everyone, but what can I say?
