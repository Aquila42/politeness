I had not seen it yet.  Do you have my other employees rankings?  Since they reccomend that the PRC Representative be involved in providing feedback, would you like to do that next week when you are here?

I assume you received this information already and I know that we have not discussed Tyrell being ranked here.  The #1 spot was tightly held by only a few people ( in the americas and as such everyone was moved down... Although the forced ranking creates problems at time, I am satisfied that Ty's ranking is appropriate... 

let's discuss, BT
