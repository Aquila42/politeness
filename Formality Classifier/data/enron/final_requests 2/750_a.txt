Mark,
Does this mean that you would prefer it to be Merrill Lynch?  If so I can
pass this on to Jeff Harbert and see if he and Bob Crane are OK with this.
I'm not sure what the clearing problems they are having in Houston are but
it might mean that you will have more legal points to finalise.  I tried to
contact Jeff to get some more information for you but he is out of the office
until Monday.
I can try him again on Tuesday but if you have any legal question or queries
you might want to speak to him yourself, his no is 001 713 8536979.   Either
way please keep me updated.
Regards,
Maria.

Maria,
The Clearing docs we got in from the Exchange showed Merrill Lynch in London
as Houston's clearer.  This is not to say this is fixed, but for some reason
the OMLX were under the impression that it would be Merrills.  By the way, we
can have as many clearers as we like (provided, of course, that they are
General Clearing Members at the OMLX).
If you could let me now quite swiftly on this issue I would be very grateful
as we finalised the legal points on Clearing docs a couple of weeks ago and I
have already couriered the final  versions for signature to Houston.
Kind regards
