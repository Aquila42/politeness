Guys,

Everybody needs to be in by 7:45am.  Please don't leave to workout before 10:30am.  If you need to leave to run errands/dr. appts, etc. during times other than lunch, just let me know ahead of time and when you'll be back.

I know it's boring, but the desks still need to be covered for questions and to put deals in during the day.  If nothing is going on, I don't care if you need to leave.  I just need to where you are.

Thanks,

Errol
