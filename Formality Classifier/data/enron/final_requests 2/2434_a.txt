The tickets are finished.  I have updated most of the third party tickets,
with the exception of Oasis/West of Prairie Lea and Oasis/East of Prairie
Lea.  I saw several May tickets with this path, and want to conserve
tickets.  I set up one ticket for this path.  Please let me know if you have
any questions.  Dave, once volumes get attached to these tickets, I would
like to run a Basis Adjustment report by pipe to double-check the desk
rates.  Thanks.
