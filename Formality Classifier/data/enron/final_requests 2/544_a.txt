The activity referenced below is really just Edison's attempt to set up a whole new series of regulatory accounts to implement its settlement with the PUC.  The fight over "who pays" will play out over the next quarter at the PUC and/or the Legislature (but most likely the PUC).

With respect to the book, Edison's proposal for "who pays" (which they've already shared with us) would have a negative impact since they're proposing that 1) all customers--bundled and DA alike--should pay down Edison's undercollection, and 2) all customers--bundled and DA alike--should pay down any stranded costs that arise from the contracts that DWR entered in to.  We've told Edison that its proposal is a non-starter.

To the extent that we can claim that any additional costs resulting from proposals like Edison's are "surcharges" as defined in our contracts and therefore should be passed through to the customer, then the impact on the book will be lessened somewhat.  Mike Smith is handling the "surcharge" issue from the perspective of our contracts.

The "surcharge issue" aside, Edison's attempts to cram more costs down business customers' throats is not going to happen without a fight. We're working closely with the business customer groups to 1) oppose Edison's proposal and 2) try to hammer out a deal with PG&E that is more fair to all, since PG&E seems considerably more willing to be somewhat reasonable.

If you have any other questions, just let me know.
