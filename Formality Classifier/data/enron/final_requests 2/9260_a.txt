To clarify the memo that I sent yesterday concerning Buyer vs. Seller on
Intercompany deals, I want to make sure that everyone understands that not
only will the Seller side post on the SITARA deal but that the Volume
Feedback Reconciliation report  will reflect the error(s) associated with the
buy side as well.  It will no longer show the the error(s) generated by the
sales side as it currently does.  This change will coincide with the way SAP
reports Intercompany transactions.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Note: The Volume Feedback Reconciliation report is the report which I
distribute on a daily basis.

Thanks,
RHP
