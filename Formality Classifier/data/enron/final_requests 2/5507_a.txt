Hi Vince,

I spoke with Ray again, and he seems to have the background necessary to
work with the insurance group here.
He is not an actuary, but he can work with data.  Would you mind calling him
on the phone sometime next week?
Please let me know what time you would call him, so I can let him know.  Once
you speak with him, then maybe we can
bring him down for interviews, if you think it appropriate.

His business phone number is 816 889 4417

Thanks,
Vasant
