There have been so many CILCO issues until I'm not sure which one you are
referencing.  If it relates to the CILCO sale that has created the large
receivable balance, then we are waiting on a response from Daren.  I met with
Daren and Kenny and we all agree that the sale between ENA-TX and CILCO is
invalid and that the sale has to be with the storage book (your group will
not have to do anything with this sale).  The problem lies in the associated
transport with that sale.  This is the piece that we need Daren's help on.  I
will touch base with Daren and see if we can get this resolved this week.  If
this is not what you are referring to, please let me know.  Thanks!

Do you have any information on this?  Fred, I know you were in the meeting we
had to discuss what needs to be done to resolve this issue.  I'm not sure who
the logistics representative was.
Thanks.
