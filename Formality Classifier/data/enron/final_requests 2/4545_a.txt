P.S. -- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See
Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for
another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such
notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please
let me know.
