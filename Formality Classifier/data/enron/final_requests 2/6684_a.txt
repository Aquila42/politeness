Ravi,

At some point we would like to include bandwidth under AOL. This clause
may be very restrictive.

Subject: Spreadsheet database for purchase

Hi Mark, as per our discussion earlier today, here is the contract that KMI
wants us to sign.  Please review as soon as you can.  As I mentioned in our
discussion, I am heading up the EBS research group reporting to Vince
Kaminski and Stinson Gibner (MDand VP of Enron Global Research,
respectively).  Vince has asked me to talk you directly on matter such as
this rather than using EBS service since we will be performing much of the
work stationed out of Enron Corp and the database itself and any resulting
analysis will reside in Research.

I took a quick look at the contract and already found some things that seems
too restrictive.  For example, the following clause may need to be removed
unless you think it would not affect us:

Fourth paragraph:  " (ii) that you are in a business that does not include
the operating of an online exchange or auction for bandwidth"

Strictly speaking, we are NOT in the business of online exchange or auction
for bandwidth (since that is how we differentiate our market-making activity
from other online exchange players such as Band-x and Rate exchange), our
trading activity can be loosely defined as such in an very immature trading
market such as the current status of telecom market.  What do you think?  I
would like to set up a meeting with you to discuss EBS and our role and how
this database will be used, etc... Please have your assistant call Kristy
Carnes to set up this meeting this week.

I thank you very much for offering to take a look at this at such a short
notice.



Regards,

Ravi.
