Got your message.  You're a pal.  Can't thank you enough.  Wish you the best
of luck on the options program.  If you can send me a copy of the
presentation on the options programs, boy, I'd love to have one.  Please give
our lovely counsel a big hug for me.  And I plan to be out there again real
soon.

Subject: GIR proceeding-- Potential Financial Impact to TW

Jeff,
Sorry I've been hard to get a hold of... we held a workshop today to talk
about our proposed Transport Options program.  I found a copy of what I'd
sent to you before.  I'll stand behind these numbers today as representing
the dollar value of the risk Transwestern faced in the proceeding.  What's
not clear from my original note is that these cost impacts were annual, and
such impacts would continue year to year thereafter until
conditions/circumstances changed.  I hope this is useful.
