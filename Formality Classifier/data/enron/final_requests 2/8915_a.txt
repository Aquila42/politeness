Please call me once you have had a chance to read through the attached memo.
Obviously, this is a highly sensitive issue and is only being discussed on a
need to know basis to minimize the chances of this becoming known outside of
Enron.   Therefore, I would prefer not to discuss this issue in your staff
meeting.  Let me know if that's a problem.
