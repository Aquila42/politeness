I talked to Maria Salazar from the Design and Drafting group in Houston
(GPG), and she is going to work with Will Zamer to get him the maps he
needs.  They already have a lot of the maps in electronic format for all of
GPG.  As she forwards to Will, she is going to copy me and I will forward to
make sure it is looking like you want it to.

Let me know if you have questions.
