With respect to the FX, interest rate, S&P and NASDAQ indice trading, as long
as your job does not involve trading those products and as long as you do not
in your job have access to the trading information (working on the confirm
desk, risk management desk, credit, etc.), you are OK to trade those
products.  We do not currently trade agricultural commodities, so you are
currently not in violation with that product group.  As you may be aware, we
have acquired a metals company, so you should also not trade any metals.

The Enron trading policy prohibits employees from trading any products the
company trades.  Please let me know if you are trading any commodities that
Enron trades, otherwise you should be OK.
