The fellowship hall would be fine with me.  If you are sure about the number, we can do that.  I have made some revisions to the list if you want to go that way instead.  Here is the revised list, just let me know.

Again, I appreciate all you are doing for me and do not want to be a nuisance.  Just to recap, I am registered at Babies 'R' Us and Target.  I have no theme.  My Babies 'R' Us registry lists colors: white, natural, sage green and that I like chenille.  Not knowing what I am having, I am keeping things simple to begin with and will add when the baby gets here.

Love,
Stacey
