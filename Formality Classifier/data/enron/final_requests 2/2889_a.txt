This afternoon I received from John Scarborough the revised flow of funds
diagram; these new numbers will be worked through attached amendment
document.  I still need the four numbers requested in my attached 5/23
e-mail:  (1) A&R LLC Agreement, Section 1.01, definition of Offer Price (need
revised Class C member interest offer price), (2) Flow of Funds Memo (need
new numbers for Section 3(a)(ii) (amount ECHO wires to ECS), (3) Flow of
Funds memo (need new number for Section 3(b) (amount ECS wires to ECHO), and
(4) Exhibit A to A&R LLC Agreement (amount of ECS' capital contribution in
respect of Gallup, presumably value of contributed assets).
Rhett Jackson has confirmed that attached amendment document is acceptable
from tax viewpoint.  I have not heard from Chris Sherman but assume also
works from accounting viewpoint based upon our prior discussions.
Thanks for your help.  Regards, NJD
