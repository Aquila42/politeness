Hello all:
According to the email below, we are going to have to bill your cell phone
invoices to your credit cards and receive reimbursement on an expense
report.
If you want me to do this, I will be glad to - I will just need your credit
card
number that you want it billed to.  I think it will only have to be done one
time and then they will automatically bill it to your card.
Let me know.
Thanks!
