Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378
for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation
process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101.
Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this
done today.  Thanls.
