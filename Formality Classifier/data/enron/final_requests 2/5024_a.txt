For whatever reason, our calls, messages and emails  have not received a
response to date.  We need to understand the nature of the transaction before
we can move forward with the CPUC.  We have put them on hold, telling them we
are waiting for Edwards to describe what they intend to put out for bid.  Can
you let me know?
