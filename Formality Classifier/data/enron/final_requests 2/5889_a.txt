Sherri:
Vince Kaminski is available from 2:00pm - 5:00 pm on Tuesday, April 18.
Sherri:  As a side note, Professor Bodily was visiting with Vince yesterday
and was impressed with the pictures that are in each of the elevators -
showing Enron's "Vision and Values".  He asked me if I could possibly
find out how he could get copies of the prints.  Are they available anywhere,
and to anyone?  Did our graphics dept. do them?
If you have any information, please let me know.
Thanks!
