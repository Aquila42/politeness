Never fear.  I've asked Janet to set up a meeting on Fri. and to make sure
the core group of you, Drew, Steve and I can attend.  If anyone else can
attend too, great.  If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough
input on Fri.

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.
