Jo,
Thanks for taking the lead on this.
As I was reviewing the sketches this morning, I was thinking that we need to
include the South American systems in this area as well.  Would Maria have
access to the maps for these systems as well?

Subject: EGPG MAP for Enron website

I talked to Maria Salazar from the Design and Drafting group in Houston
(GPG), and she is going to work with Will Zamer to get him the maps he
needs.  They already have a lot of the maps in electronic format for all of
GPG.  As she forwards to Will, she is going to copy me and I will forward to
make sure it is looking like you want it to.

Let me know if you have questions.
