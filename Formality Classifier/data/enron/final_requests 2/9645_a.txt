Per my conv. w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never
requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.  Per our
understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the
counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them.

Tana,
Can you confirm the status of the amendment with Crestar?
Thanks,
