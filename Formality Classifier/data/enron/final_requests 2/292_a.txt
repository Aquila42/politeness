We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.  We do not
need to let this keep growing.  Talked with Chuck Thompson (PNM) and we bothed have agreed that TW is not
to overdeliver to PNM until we can varify the measurements.  We will work on this next week.
