Mark -
Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and
strategy.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs
