AFAC and Marcelo:  I hope this message finds you both well.  I would like to
finalize the matrix which was prepared last year so that we can create a
"baseline" for future updates.  Please feel free to date the matrix as of
December, 1999, if you wish.  Please forward any recent changes to me for
comment  and I will respond immediately.  Then we can move on to other
things!  Thanks for your help and attention to this mattter.  Regards.  Sara
