Oh, ok, I didn't know that. - wish I lived in France for August then.  As
long as it is ok with you that we don't get this purchased soon.  I just
wanted to make sure I did everything I could to get the software for you.

Karla,

August is a vacation month in France.

I would not count on a response any time soon.

Ms. Geman,

I am just following up to see if you had received my previous message
forwarded below and whether you have a response so that we can move forward
with this contract?

Thank you ,
