Hello,

I need to send our format for incoming guaranty to some of my liquids
customers.  The format does not need any power language.  Please let  me know
if it is OK to take out the highlighted language from the format I will be
using for the financial and physical liquids Gty.  (No master swap has been
signed yet.)





Thanks,

Nidia
