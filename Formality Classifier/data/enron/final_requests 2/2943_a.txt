Hello Mr. Kaminski,
I am available to meet with you for lunch this week on Tuesday (2/1),
Wednesday (2/2). or Friday (2/4). Which day would be more convenient for you?
Please let me know.
I am planning to meet with Mr. Chris Holmes (introduced by a mutual family
friend) of Enron's Energy Services next week. Mr. Holmes also suggested that
I meet with you.
Looking forward to the meeting. I will call you to follow up. For convenience
I am attaching my latest resume.
Thank you.
