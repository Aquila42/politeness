The whole schedule has yet to be determined.  I'm still waiting for final
seating charts from the other groups so I can figure out how to most
efficiently get people moved into their new homes.  We'll let you know as
soon as possible.

Mark, I understand that I'm moving too.  When?  I'm going on vacation
starting August 26th and will be out that entire next week and also will be
out on August 18th to finish up my dental work.  I've already asked Joya to
let me know as soon as she does regarding firm dates so I can get Carol
packed and know where to send her things.  Please advise.  Thanks, Suz
