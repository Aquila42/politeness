Clement:  We have an add'l issue on the LM  6000's and that is on IDC.  My
understanding is when we originally structured the sharing of the West LB
interim interest, we were assuming the turbines would move out of the
facility to Project Facilities.  Since we have turbines that do not have
homes, but will continue to incur add'l IDC, we would like to agree on a new
methodology for accruing IDC per turbine.  We look forward to meeting with
you soon to discuss this.  Let me know when you are available.

Thanks, Thomas.
