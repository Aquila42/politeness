Dear Richard,
Thanks for your message - I just met Lloyd Fleming who is setting up meetings
for me and getting me some of the information requested.  Houston Research
has started on this process, but I believe that I will take over from here -
I am in Houston in 10 days time and will also discuss initial findings with
them.
Regards,
Anjam Hmad

Phil Redman will come to see you to capture appropriate tasks on the overall
project plan and identify dependencies.
I hope Lloyd has kept you up to date so far.
I have added you to the address list for daily updates affecting the Support
functions.
