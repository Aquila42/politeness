Bridgette,

As discussed, I will provide to you today those recently executed Master Netting Agreements, so they can be placed in "electronic form/pdf format".

However, at present could you advise if the following counterparty (a) Master Netting Agreement, and (b) Amendment(s) (if applicable) were ever placed in electronic form:

New Power Company (The)

a.  Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement
b.  First Amendment


PG&E

a.  Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement
b.  First Amendment
c.  Second Amendment
d.  Third Amendment

Koch-Entergy Trading, LP

I appreciate your immediate attention to this request.

Cordially,
