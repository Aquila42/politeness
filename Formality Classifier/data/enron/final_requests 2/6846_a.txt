I was forwarded a copy of Fernley's announcement regarding your new role for
Global Products Trading Support.  Your discussions in Houston last week must
have swayed you to accept the challenges that are there.  Congratulations on
your new role.  As you step into your new position, please let me know how I
can best support you in my role over Global Risk Management Operations.  I am
forwarding  a copy of the announcement regarding my expanded role that was
sent out in January.  Assuming that you were not paying particular attention
to trading operations issues at that point in time, this may be one of those
e:mail messages that you skipped.  I thought that it might be helpful for you
to understand the focus that I will have in working with trading operations
groups around the globe.  I certainly will look forward to working with you,
Tim and Kevin.

I understand that Kevin will move into a role that is focused full-time on
systems implementation.  Who will assume the day-to-day lead responsibility
for Global Products trading operations in Houston and how will that
individual report in to you?

I will be in the London office during the week of March 20.  I will leave
Houston on Sunday evening, so that I should be in the office by noon on
Monday.  I plan to be there through Thursday evening.  Let me know if you
will be in town that week, so that we can schedule some time together.
