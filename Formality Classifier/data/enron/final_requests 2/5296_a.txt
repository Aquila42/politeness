I think your idea is a good one and should work fine.  I don't think the
joint & several issue should be a problem; there is not a lot of liability
under the ETA (mostly disclaimers and Enron exculpatory clauses) so the key
issue is making sure we can hold the right entity liable for transactions.
That shouldn't be a problem under the side letter, which could make the point
clear.  The only other issue I can think of is making sure that the necessary
reps re physical trading (trade option, capacity, energy-related issues) are
obtained from the right entity, but presumably this can also be covered under
the side letter.  Please call if you want to discuss.
Best regards.

I would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this
problem.  What do you think of a side agreement among both KN entities and
Enron
which specifies that a user ID and password have been issued to both of KN's
legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain
products
(e.g. all financial products) entered into under that user ID and password
will
be deemed executed by KN Trading (their financial trading entity) and all
others
will be deemed executed by KN Marketing (their physical entity)?  Do you see
any
problems here?  Issues re: joint & several liability under the ETA but not the
Transactions?

Let me know if you need further clarification of the problem.

I haven't run this by Louise yet - she may raise system or commercial
objections.
