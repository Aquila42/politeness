I don't see any problems.  It will become more challenging as we start
thinking about trading.

Apparently our people are already working with Louise Kitchen.  The issue I
described yesterday is described below.  Basically we want to make reference
to Enron Online in an informational site we will possibly be participating in
Colombia.  Please let me know if you see any problem with this.
Thank you.
