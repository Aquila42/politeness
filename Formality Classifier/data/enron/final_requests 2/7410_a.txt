I think it would be very useful if I had a copy of the policy, thanks.

Matt,
Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best, given that we already
put underwriters on notice that there was contamination, and given that we
have worked closely with Minton's, underwriters' representatives, I would
assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a  total
quantum before the joint survey  takes place; in fact, it looks like the
final determination of ECT's total quantum of damages may be impacted by the
results of the joint survey (although I would not necessarily want to say
that to underwriters at this point).
My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which
would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum. The policy
specifically requires, under "INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS", that ECT file a
claim in writing against the "delivering carrier holding him responsible as
soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is
not apparent; details can be furnished later.  Such action will not prejudice
your insurance claim."  Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent
policy; I have already sent a copy to David.
I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the
cargo currently in Thailand and will give him a call tomorrow morning at 9:00
a.m. Houston time to discuss.  Although I know that is quite late for you,
you are more than welcome to participate (just e-mail me a telephone number
at which you can be reached, or give me a call at that time).

With reference to Cliff Bennett's note, do you know whether our cargo
underwriters require notice of the amount of our potential claim? As you
know, previous figures were very rough estimates and only considered the
rejected cargo and associated freight and demurrage. We have not computed the
costs of the Thai cargo loss (if any) and the various testing and analyses
costs.

Matt

FYI - Please see below Cliff Bennett's recommendations for joint testing.

I spoke briefly with Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in
Thailand. He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some
time end August/early September premised on delivery and acceptance of the
first Elang cargo and subject to First Gas's consumption.

Cargo still not sold. Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the
cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price, but will be giving it
somethought to arrive at an estimate.

The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive,
but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec, but principal reason for not
delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D3605 as a test method.

Summary of Thailand samples test results:

6 July 2000 - Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was
tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt. Filterable
Dirt was off spec at 6.3; Carbon Residue 10% was off spec at 1.5. SGS
Thailand suggested that the  Carbon Residue 10% result was questionable and
recommended retesting. There were however, no other ship composite samples
taken before discharge in Thailand. Shoretank samples tested by SGS Thailand
for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt on the same date were on spec.

12 July 2000 -  Thailand shoretank samples brought to SGS Singapore tested on
spec except for Lead which tested off spec at 0.3 (T-961) and 0.2 (T-964).
"Ashing" test used for metals.

13 July  2000 - Thailnd shoretank samples brought to Caleb Brett Singapore
tested on spec, but note different test method used (D5184/5185).

14 July 2000 - Thailand shoretank samples re-tested for metals by SGS
Singapore:

Direct D3605
Vanadium off spec at 0.9 (T-964)
Lead off spec at 0.8 (T-961); 1 (T-964)
Vanadium + Lead off spec at 1.2 (T-961); 1.9 (T-964)

"Ashing"
Lead off spec at 0.3 (T-964)

Matt
