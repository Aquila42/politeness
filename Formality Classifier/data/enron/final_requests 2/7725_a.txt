Faye has completed creating the AVG BLANCO meter on the EPNG/BLANCO zone.
The physical location server has been bounced and  in order to see it in
Sitara, you will have to close all open Sitara applications (including the
Launch Pad) and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call me at
x35423.

Bob, the new portfolios that your group will need to monitor to track these
new BLANCO and AVG BLANCO transactions are listed below.  You can open these
portfolios in Deal Manager or Deal Ticker.

Deal Confirm - EPNG/BLANCO
Deal Confirm - EPNG/AVGBLANCO
