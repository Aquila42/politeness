Here is my proposed response.  Let me know if you want to mention the last
item or not.  Thanks.

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian
issues as well.
