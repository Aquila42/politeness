Mark:
I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the
following in connection with my leave that you have approved:
1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on
adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for
2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.
2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence.
Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am
not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just
pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you
informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.
3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should
know more after next Wednesday.
Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
