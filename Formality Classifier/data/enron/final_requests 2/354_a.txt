Tracey and John,

Please review the Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  John, please see the red-lined language regarding taxes that you sent me, let me know if you want to add anything else.

This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.
