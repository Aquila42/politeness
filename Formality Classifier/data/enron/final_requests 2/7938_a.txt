Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade
TODAY.  We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the
transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a
parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara
