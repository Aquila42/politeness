Subject: Document control

Drew,
Attached is the latest revision of the Document Control Investigation Report
with further details provided by Contract Administration concerning the
operation of the file room.

Do you have any problem with me forwarding this document to Mary Kay?  Or if
you would prefer, you now have the latest and can forward it to her
yourself?  The call is yours, just let me know.

It's a pleasure working with you as always,
Sarabeth
