Mark:

Attached please find the other e-mail summarizing the pending jurisdictional
matters. Please note that Justin and I have determined that because Enron
could be exposed to criminal liability in the Netherlands, we will exclude
residents notwithstanding low risk of prosecution.  We are awaiting advise re
rather the same state of affairs exists in Italy - low probability of
prosecution but some risk of criminal liability.
