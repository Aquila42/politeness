John,

As of Wednesday, we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping  us
isolate the problems we're having with the UNIX operating system and our
code.  This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application
specialist from SUN.  This has been authorized and the additional resource is
scheduled to be on site next week.  I also have my resources and the UNIX
administrators working along side the Sun resources.

As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side
of the business.  I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are
putting a plan in place.  The increased trading volumes have seriously
impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.

These problems have not gone unnoticed.  I assure you that IT has been very
diligent in following through on these problems.  We're investing heavily in
additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources
at an average of 5 - 8 per week.  I will keep you posted as we continue to
enhance our existing systems.

Beth
