Hi,

I was not trying to avoid your e-mail - I am sorry you thought that.  I am just not very exciting these days and do not have much to say.  I know the job market is tough and I do feel lucky.  Things here are very slow and we are not getting counterparties signed up very quickly.  I do not think UBS will be hiring for awhile - not until we are fully operational which could be a few months yet.  I am sure Cindy is doing everything she can.  Have you tried Conoco?  I heard they are hiring.  The estate may be hiring for contract employees in accounting.  That is all I have heard.  Let me know when we can get together.
