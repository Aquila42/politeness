Steve,

Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed.  I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the inital fee of $1,000 will be waived.

The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.  It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.

Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.  Also, there will be no additional cost to hook this up while we are on the 13 floor and move it
