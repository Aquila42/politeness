Steve:
Osman has been working on setting up this meeting and its agenda. I already
informed John Henderson about this as he is the main person from Resco. Both
Osman and I will be involved from the Research modeling angle. Osman will
contact you today regarding this.
Thanks,
Krishna.

Vince,

I was not going to be involved directly in the meeting.  Who from either your
group or from Resco Marketing should participate?

Thanks,

Steve

Steve,

It makes sense to meet with Abacus. Retail marketing is very data intensive.
If you set up a meeting with them,
please, let me know.

Tim,

I hope things are going well in Resco.  I think somebody from Resco (or
Research) may be interested in the email I received below from Brad Davids.
Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as
well as predictive modelling.  He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this
month.  I'm not sure who is responsible for Resco Marketing, but I think they
would find this interesting.  Who should I send this to?   Please let me know
if anybody in Resco may have any interest.

Thanks,

Steve

PS:  Vince, simply an FYI since they do focus on modelling and research.
