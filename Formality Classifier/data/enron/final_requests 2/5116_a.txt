Looks good to me--and I agree that we ought to use if for internal purposes
only.  If people at the customer meeting want more detail than you guys are
able to provide orally, we could consider adding detail to the FERC filing or
even sending them some additional explanation that we may or may not decide
to file with FERC.  Good luck today!  DF

Subject: revised TW Options Q&A

I'm distributing [internally] the brief answers we've crafted for each of the
customer's questions.  I think we're on pretty solid ground in each case.  As
mentioned below, we won't be distrubuting these answers during the workshop.
We'll use them for our own purposes in answering the questions orally.  If
you have any questions regarding this issue, please let me know.
