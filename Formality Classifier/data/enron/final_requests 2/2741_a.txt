Leslie:
I would run everything passed Dave Forester since we need his approval on the
amendment letter for your piece anyway and see what he says.

I've talked to John this morning and am working to finalize my agency
language.  FYI, my preference is to set up GPU with 3 separate passwords --
GPU Service Inc. as agent for Met Ed, GPU Service Inc. as agent for Penn, and
GPU Service Inc. as agent for NJ.  Pending resolution of Enpower bridging
issues this afternoon, I intend to precede along this path since GPU is
amenable.  Do you think we should have GPU execute 3 separate ETA Amendments
in each capacity separately or do you think we should have them sign 3
password applications and execute one ETA Amendment relating to all three
capacities.
