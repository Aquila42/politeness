Carol:

I think we will need your input regarding these subordination issues since
they affect ENA's rights under the swap documents.  I believe Lou is going to
try to schedule a meeting today to discuss.  It would be helpful if you could
join us.  Might you be available?

I will send you a chart of the structure of the transaction.

Thanks.

Teresa
