Greg,

I mailed you a check for the full balance due to Kipp Flores.  I am not excited or optimistic about our case.  Too me, it is just a lesson learned.

Regarding Jeff Smith, I am ok with the idea of giving him an exclusive on his clients for four months.  I want him to be as motivated as possible to sell.  Did you discuss any strategies of how to package the property?  Sold once occupied or while in construction?  What sort of conditions would be required by a buyer?

Let me know
